	<H3>Version 6.2.0 (October 31, 2011)</H3>
        <blockquote>
	    Added plume centerline temperature calculation from work of McCaffrey, Heskestad, and Evans. This is
	    now used for the surrounding gas temperature for target calculations. Note that at this 
	    point, it only impacts targets directly over a fire source.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
	    Updated spreadsheet column headings to be more readable and useful, including units. This also added
	    the option for a net heat flux output (now the default) for all target heat flux outputs.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
	    Added cylindrical targets largely aimed at improving calculation of heat flux to and temperature of
	    wire and cable targets.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
	    General code cleanup, verification, and validation.  This included removal of numerous unused variables that were
 	    left over from earlier features long since removed from the model.  Code logic analysis with
	    Forcheck to ensure call and variable consistency, additional and repeated validation tests.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
	    Added detailed discussion of CFAST's fire chemistry and target calculations to Technical Reference Guide.  Updated
	    User's Guide and Validation Guide for latest version.
	</blockquote>

	<H3>Version 6.1.1 (Febrary 4, 2009)</H3>
        <blockquote>
            Added a new species, labeled TS, to track flow through compartments. TS is a trace
            species produce during pyrolysis and is not affected by combustion. The assumption
            is that molecules are large enough to be filtered, but that mass is small compared
            to the overall pyrolysis. See NISTIR 7498 for an example of its use.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            Added the ability to specify filtering for mechanical ventilation systems which
            applies to soot and the trace species. For the user, it is implemented wtih the
            EVENT,F command and available through the GUI. See the User’s Guide, NIST Special
            Publication 1041 (May 2008 Revision) for details.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            Separated pyrolysis and combustion kinetics. The original purpose was to fix a bug
            related to pyrolysis products not being transported to the upper layer when a fire
            is only in the upper layer. The code was structured so that a consistent combustion
            model for a plume could be implemented. Species affected only by pyrolysis are hydrogren
            choloride, hydrogen cyanide, trace species and the concentration time product. Species
            affected only by kinetics are carbon-dioxide, carbon-monoxide, and soot. Species
            affected by both are oxygen and fuel. Nitrogen is inert and only transported.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            Corrected error in mechanical ventilation that prevented flow from dropping off
            at high pressures like it was supposed too. An additional error casued DASSL to
            fail at times when the mechanical ventilatino system shut off due to (the now corrected)
            high pressure cutoff.&nbsp; The solution was to not totally close the vent (the
            vent is left open at an extremely small value, machine epsilson for double precision)&nbsp; Corrected error in exehandle routine that caused
            model to fail with path names longer than 128 characters (windows limit is 255 characters
            for whole file name).&nbsp;
            Corrected error in interpolation routines for opening and closing vents that did
            not smoothly transistion from open to closed (Since the GUI did this over 1 s, the
            impact should not be noticeable for previously run cases).</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            Incorporated Heskestad plume model as an alternative to the McCaffrey plume model
            (type 2).&nbsp; There is a small difference in the calculated results for a range
            of test cases (on the order of 2% to 4%).&nbsp; The plan is to add plume temperature
            to the calculation as well.
	</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
	    Smokeview updated to improve visualization of vent flows (now accounts for vent opening and closing)
	    and smoke (3-D smoke visualization now an option that depends on calculation optical density).
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            Corrected error in the GUI that incorrectly outputs the mechanical ventilation specification
            for the CFAST model.&nbsp; The fifth parameter on the line specifies a "system number"
            for each mechanical ventilation system.&nbsp; In older versions, this began with
            1 for each compartment rather than being numbered sequentially throughout.&nbsp;
            The impact was that opening and closing of vents would not work when there were
            mechanical ventilation fans in more than one compartment.&nbsp; Calculation was
            correct for fully-opened mechanical vents.</blockquote>

        <h3>
            Version 6.0.10 (January 11, 2007)</h3>
        <blockquote>
            Beginning with version 6.0.10, CFAST and CEdit were compiled with Visual Studio
            2005.&nbsp; This means that both new and existing users of earlier versions of the
            Windows CFAST will need to download and install Microsoft .NET version 2.0 (included
            in the larger download of CFAST) if it is not already installed on their computer.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            Corrected subscript error in cfast input checking for ceiling-floor conduction connections
            that caused an error with simulations with 5 or more compartments. Corrected an
            error in the definition of fire objects to allow radiative fraction to be zero,
            not just greater than zero. Corrected a display error for CFAST files in smokeview
            that placed fires in the wrong compartment for visualization; calculations, spreadsheet,
            and printed output were correct.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            Updated the GUI to Visual Studio 2005, including spreadsheet, auto-sizing, and preview
            libraries.
            Reversed order of CFAST log file in the message summary so that any errors would
            appear at the top of the list, more visible to the user. Changed limit on number
            of mechanical ventilation connections from 10 to 100. Corrected an error that prevented
            saving of an input file when compartments were removed from a simulation. Corrected
            an error that caused incorrect values for default fire position when engineering
            units were not set to m. Fixed compartment naming when a compartment is duplicated.
            Corrected an error when defining a new fire that did not assign a material to
            the fire (leading to an error 205 when running CFAST). Enabled RTI input for heat alarms
            (Previously, heat alarms were presumed to have a default value for
            the RTI). Corrected a subscript error that caused GUI error message for a compartment
            specified as a single zone if the compartment was the highest numbered compartment
            in the simulation.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            Added the ability to define a general t-squared growth rate fire to the Edit Fire
            Objects window, allowing the user to select growth rate, peak HRR, steady burning
            time, and decay time, including predefined constants for slow, medium, fast, and
            ultra-fast t-squared fires. Added the ability to add and remove thermal properties
            on the thermal properties edit window. Redesigned the heat transfer connection tab to separate
            horizontal and vertical heat transfer specifications to allow for future enhancement
            of the horizontal connections to better support the HHEAT keyword in CFAST; for
            the moment, only a single, fractional connection is allowed on a given keyword
            line. Note that vertical heat transfer always assumes a fraction of one
            for the connection.</blockquote>

			<P>Corrected error in CFAST where ignition time of a fire was off by 1 s when

                Corrected error in specification of alternate thermal property files that would

				was changed. Corrected links to GUI text boxes for HCl constants 2 through 7 
				that prevented editing of these constants. Corrected size of summary 
				spreadsheets in the GUI to be consistent with CFAST design limits.&nbsp; This 
				would cause the program to crash if you had more than 50 vents or targets in a 
				single simulation. Heat source fire on Fires tab was not actually implemented in the model; this 
				has been removed from the GUI. Corrected units in the GUI for HCl and HCN.&nbsp; They were listed as kg/s by 
				default rather than&nbsp;kg/kg (dimensionless). This would lead to incorrect 
				species yields for simulations with user selected units other than kg for mass 
				and s for time.</p>

			</P>
		</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>The ambient flux calculations seem to be too high. The problem lies in 
				specification of object properties. The fire has to release energy over a 
				finite volume. As the size of this volume is reduced, the energy per unit 
				volume goes up and thus the heat flux rises. There is a physical limit on the 
				maximum such energy release per unit volume. As pointed out by Orloff and deRis 
				("Froude Modeling of Pool Fires," Factory Mutual Technical Report OHON3.BU, 
				Norwood (1983)), there is a physical limit on the maximum such energy release 
				per unit volume. This limitation arises because mixing and diffusion take a 
				finite amount of time, and radiation is limited by optical depth, at least for 
				fires of the sort we consider in CFAST, namely buoyant diffusion flames. The 
				upper limit is 1.2 MW/m3. An object model which is the area of the object as 
				defined in the database (.o) and the height extent which includes a maximum 
				flame length is used to make this estimate. The input routine, INPUTOBJECT, 
				does this calculation, with a warning at 2 MW/m3, and a stop with the error 
				code 221 at 4 MW/m3. The minimum object volume is now 1.0x10-6 m3.

		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>Initial release of version 6 of CFAST, including a Windows version of the CEdit 
				graphical user interface. Fires are now treated as objects, which can be placed 
				and sized within compartments. Mechanical ventilation has been simplified to 
				fan/opening pairs, and all vents (vertical flow, horizontal flow and forced 
				flow) can be turned off or on (single instance).
