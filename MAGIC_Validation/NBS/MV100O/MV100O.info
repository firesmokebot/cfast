 Choice of numerical method 
 ---------------------------
 Used method : Pure Broyden (std)
 Maximum time step in seconds = 15.000
  
 Plume calculation option (Fixed)
 --------------------------------
  Circular plume low. layer or upp.: circular TANAKA law
  Linear plume  low. layer or upp. : linear ZUKOSKI law
  Plume at an opening              : circular TANAKA law
  Linear plume : low. layer --> upp: linear ZUKOSKI law
  Circular plume : low. layer --> u: circular TANAKA law
 - > plume calculation at openings without wall
 - > Upper layer penetration without Cooper law
 - > Circular source without vitual origin use
 - > Linear source without virtual origin use 
  
 koppdt value :   2
