\chapter{The Basic Transport Equations}
\label{sec:Theory_Chapter}

The equations used in CFAST take the form of an initial value problem for a system of ordinary differential equations. These equations are derived from the conservation laws of mass and energy (equivalently the first law of thermodynamics) and the ideal gas law. These equations predict as functions of time quantities such as pressure, layer height and temperatures given the gains and losses of mass and energy in the two layers. The assumption of a zone model is that properties such as temperature can be approximated throughout a control volume by an average value. Many formulations based upon these assumptions can be derived. Though equivalent mathematically, these formulations differ in their numerical solution.

The exchange of mass and enthalpy between zones is due to physical phenomena such as fire plumes, natural and forced ventilation, convective and radiative heat transfer, and so on. For example, a vent exchanges mass and enthalpy between zones in connected rooms, a fire plume typically adds heat to the upper layer and transfers entrained mass and enthalpy from the lower to the upper layer, and convection transfers enthalpy from the gas layers to the surrounding walls.


 It is assumed that each compartment is divided into two control volumes, a relatively hot upper layer and a relatively cool lower layer, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:Control_Volumes}. The gas temperature and density are assumed constant in each layer. The compartment as a whole is assumed to have a single value of pressure, $P$. It is also assumed that all thermodynamic parameters are constant. The specific heat at constant volume and at constant pressure, $c_v$ and $c_p$, the universal gas constant, $R$, and the ratio of specific heats, $\gamma$, are related by $\gamma = c_p / c_v$ and $R = c_p- c_v$.  For ambient air, $c_p \approx 1$~kJ/(kg $\cdot$ K) and $\gamma = 1.4$.

 \label{fig:Control_Volumes}
\end{figure}
Conservation of mass in each layer, $\dot m_i$, is expressed
\be
   \dbydt{m_i} = \dot m_i  \label{mass_con}
\ee
Conservation of energy takes the form of the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the rate of increase of internal energy plus the rate at which the layer does work by expansion is equal to the rate at which enthalpy is added to the gas:
\be
   \dbydt{(c_v m_i T_i)} +  P \dbydt{V_i} =  \dot h_i \label{eq:first_law}
\ee
The enthalpy source term, $\dot h_i$, consists of the fire's heat release rate, conduction losses to walls, and radiation exchange. The layer temperature and mass are related to the layer volume and compartment pressure via the ideal gas law:
\be
  P \, V_i = m_i \, R \, T_i \label{EoS}
\ee
A system of ordinary differential equations for the compartment pressure, upper layer volume, and layer temperatures can be derived from these three basic principles:
\begin{eqnarray}
\dbydt{P} &=& \frac{{\gamma-1}}{{V}} \left( \dhl + \dhu \right)  \\[.1in]
\dbydt{\Vu} &=& \frac{1}{P \gamma} \left( (\gamma-1) \, \dhu - \Vu \dbydt{P} \right) \\[.1in]
\dbydt{\Tu} &=& \frac{1}{c_p \, m_{\rm u}} \left( \dhu - c_p \, \dmau \, \Tu + \Vu \dbydt{P} \right) \\[.1in]
\dbydt{\Tl} &=& \frac{1}{c_p \, m_{\rm l}} \left( \dhl - c_p \, \dmau \, \Tl + \Vl \dbydt{P} \right)
\end{eqnarray}
As discussed in Refs.~\cite{Forney:1994} and \cite{Rehm:1992}, these equations are stiff, meaning that the pressure adjusts to changing conditions more quickly than the other variables. Runge-Kutta methods or predictor-corrector methods such as Adams-Bashforth require prohibitively small time steps in order to track the short time scale phenomena (pressure in our case). Methods that calculate the Jacobian (or at least approximate it) have a much larger stability region for stiff problems and are thus more successful at their solution.





\chapter{The Fire Plume}
\label{sec:TheFire}

Fires in CFAST are specified by the user in terms of a time-dependent heat release rate (HRR), an effective fuel molecule, and the yields of the products of incomplete combustion like soot and CO. Fires can be specified in multiple compartments and are treated as totally separate entities, with no interaction of the plumes. These fires are generally referred to as ``objects'' and can be ignited at a prescribed time, temperature or heat flux.

CFAST does not include a pyrolysis model to {\em predict}, as opposed to specify, the growth and spread of the fire. Rather, pyrolysis rates for each fire are prescribed by the user. While this approach does not directly account for increased pyrolysis due to radiative feedback from the flame or compartment, in theory these effects could be prescribed by the user. In an actual fire, this is an important consideration, and the specification used should consider the experimental conditions as closely as possible.

\section{Combustion Chemistry}

 The HRR of the fire is specified by the user, but it may be constrained by the availability of oxygen in the compartment. The combustion of a hydrocarbon fuel is described by the following single-step reaction:
\begin{eqnarray}
   \mathrm{C_{n_\C}H_{n_H}O_{n_O}N_{n_N}Cl_{n_{Cl}}} &+&  \nu_\OTWO \, \mathrm{O_2}  \rightarrow  \nonumber \\[.1in]
   \nu_\COTWO \, \mathrm{CO_2} &+& \nu_\HTWOO \, \mathrm{H_2O} \; + \; \nu_\CO \, \mathrm{CO} \; + \; \nu_\So \, \mathrm{Soot} \; + \; \nu_\HCl \mathrm{HCl} \; + \; \nu_\HCN \mathrm{HCN} \label{stoich}
\end{eqnarray}
The user specifies the composition of the fuel molecule and the yields of soot and CO, $y_\So$ and $y_\CO$, which are related to their stoichiometric coefficients as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
   \nu_\So &=& \frac{M_\F}{M_\So} \; y_\So \label{soot_yield} \\[.1in]
   \nu_\CO &=& \frac{M_\F}{M_\CO} \; y_\CO \label{CO_yield}
\end{eqnarray}
Under the assumption that all of the nitrogen and chlorine in the fuel are converted to HCN and HCl, the other stoichiometric coefficients are:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nu_\COTWO &=& \mathrm{n_\C} - \brackets{\nu_\CO + \nu_\HCN + \nu_\So} \\[.1in]
  \nu_\HTWOO &=& \frac{\mathrm{n_\Hy} - \brackets{\nu_\HCl + \nu_\HCN}}{2} \\[.1in]
  \nu_\OTWO  &=& \nu_\COTWO + \frac{\nu_\HTWOO + \nu_\CO - \mathrm{n_\Oh}}{2} \label{Oxygen_yield} \\[.1in]
  \nu_\HCl   &=& \mathrm{n_{Cl}} \\[.1in]
  \nu_\HCN   &=& \mathrm{n_{N}}
\end{eqnarray}
Note that the nitrogen in the air acts only as a diluent. The yields of hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen chloride are based solely on the composition of the fuel molecule. Finally, a user-specified trace species can be specified to follow the transport that results from fire-induced flow for an arbitrary species. This may be of particular interest for radiological releases \cite{Jones:2008}, but may be useful for any trace amounts released by a fire.

\section{Heat Release Rate}

As fuel and oxygen are consumed, heat is released and various products of combustion are formed. The heat is released as radiation and convected enthalpy:
\begin{eqnarray}
   \dQr &=& \chi_{\rm r} \, \dQ \\[.1in]
   \dQc &=& (1-\chi_{\rm r}) \, \dQ
\end{eqnarray}
where, $\chi_{\rm r}$ is the fraction  of the fire's heat release rate given off as radiation. The default value to 0.30~\cite{Drysdale:1985}.

While it is convenient for the user to directly specify the heat release rate of the fire, it is actually the pyrolysis rate of fuel, $\dmf$, that is specified:
\be
   \dmf = \frac{\dQ}{\Dh}
\ee
where $\Dh$ is the heat of combustion. In the event that the HRR is constrained by the availability of oxygen, the pyrolysis rate does not change, but the HRR becomes:
\be
   \dQ = \min \Big( \dmf \, \Dh \, , \, \dme \, Y_\OTWO \, C_{\rm LOL} \, \DhO \Big)
\ee
where $\dme$ is the entrainment rate, $Y_\OTWO$ is the mass fraction of oxygen in the layer containing the fire, $\DhO$ is the heat of combustion based on oxygen consumption\footnote{The heat of combustion based on oxygen consumption is taken to be 13.1~MJ/kg, representative of typical hydrocarbon fuels~\cite{Huggett:1980}.}, and $C_{\rm LOL}$ is the smoothing function ranging from 0 to 1:
\be
   C_{\rm LOL} = \frac{\tanh \Big( 800 (Y_\OTWO - Y_{\OTWO,{\rm l}}) - 4 \Big) + 1}{2}
\ee
The limiting oxygen mass fraction, $Y_{\OTWO,{\rm l}}$, is 0.1, by default.



\section{Plume Entrainment}

The mass entrainment of air, $\dme(z)$, into the plume at a height $z$ above the base of the fire is estimated using either McCaffrey's~\cite{McCaffrey:1983} or Heskestad's~\cite{Heskestad:1984} correlation. McCaffrey divides the flame/plume into three regions:
\be
   \frac{\dme(z)}{\dQ} = \left\{ \begin{array}{r@{\quad \quad}l}
   0.011 \brackets{\ZQf}^{0.566} &  0.00 \leq \brackets{\ZQf}<0.08 \\[.1in]
   0.026 \brackets{\ZQf}^{0.909} &  0.08 \leq \brackets{\ZQf}<0.20 \label{eq:McCaffreyPlume} \\[.1in]
   0.124 \brackets{\ZQf}^{1.895} &  0.20 \leq \brackets{\ZQf} \end{array} \right.
\ee
Heskestad analyzed both his own data \cite{Heskestad:1984} and that of Zukoski \cite{Zukoski:1981} to develop the correlation
\be
   \dme(z) = 0.071 \, \dQ_{\rm c}^{1/3} \; \brackets{z - z_0}^{5/3} \; \brackets{1 + 0.026 \, \dQ_{\rm c}^{2/3} \, \brackets{z-z_0}^{-5/3}}
\ee
where $z_0$ is a virtual origin for the fire plume defined as
\be
  z_0/D = -1.02 + 0.083 \dQ^{2/5} / D
\ee
which is based on the total heat release rate of the fire, $\dQ$.  Both correlations provide similar results in CFAST calculations.

In CFAST, there is a constraint on the mass entrainment rate because the plume can rise only so high for a given HRR.  Early in a fire, the plume may not have sufficient energy to reach the compartment ceiling. Therefore, a limit is placed on the entrainment rate. For the plume to be able to penetrate the hot upper layer, the density of the gas in the plume must be less than the density of the gas in the upper layer. This implies that the upper layer temperature must be less than the plume temperature:
\be
   \Tu < \Tp \approx \frac{ \dQc + \dme \, c_p \, \Tl }{ \dme \, c_p}
\ee
Rearranging terms yields a limit on the mass entrainment:
\be
   \dm_e < \frac{\dQc}{c_p (\Tu - \Tl)}
\ee


\section{Plume Centerline Temperature}

CFAST includes an empirical correlation of plume centerline gas temperature based on the work of Baum and McCaffrey~\cite{Baum:1989} with a modification by Evans~\cite{Evans:1984} to account for the presence of a hot gas layer. The correlation gives the excess temperature as a function of height above a fire, $z$, for the flaming, intermittent, and plume regions:
\be
   \frac{\Delta \Tp}{T_\infty} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l@{\quad \quad}l}
   2.91                   &  0.00 \leq z/D^* < 1.32  \\[.1in]
   3.81 \, (z/D^*)^{-1}   &  1.32 \leq z/D^* < 3.30 \\[.1in]
   8.41 \, (z/D^*)^{-5/3} &  3.30 \leq z/D^* \end{array} \right.
\ee
where
\be
  D^* = \left( \frac{\dQ}{\rho_\infty c_p T_\infty \sqrt{g}} \right)^{2/5}
\ee
Figure~\ref{fig:Plume_Temp} shows the correlation. When a hot layer forms, the correlation must be modified since the plume now includes added enthalpy due to the entrainment of hot layer gases. Evans~\cite{Evans:1984} defines a virtual source and heat release rate to extend the plume into the upper layer. Evans' method defines the strength and location of the substitute source with respect to the interface between the upper and lower layers by

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.0in]{FIGURES/Theory/Plume_Temperature}\\
\end{center}
\caption{Excess plume centerline temperature from Baum and McCaffrey correlation.}
 \label{fig:Plume_Temp}
\end{figure}

\be Q_{I,2}^* = \brackets{\frac{1 + C_T {Q_{I,1}^*}^{2/3}}{\xi C_T} - \frac{1}{C_T}}^{3/2} \ee

\be Z_{I,2} = \brackets{\frac{\xi Q_{I,1}^* C_T}{{Q_{I,2}^*}^{1/3}\brackets{\brackets{\xi - 1}\brackets{\beta^2 + 1}+ \x1 C_T {Q_{I,2}^*}^{2/3}}}}^{2/5} Z_{I,1}  \ee

\be Q_{I,1}^* = \frac{Q_{f,C}}{\rho_\infty c_p T_\infty \sqrt{g} Z_{I,1}^{5/2}}  \ee
where $Z_{I,1}$ is the distance from the fire to the interface between the upper and lower gas layers, $Z_{I,2}$ is the distance from the virtual source to the layer interface, $\xi$ is the ratio of the upper to lower layer temperature, $\beta$ is an experimentally determined constant \cite{Zukoski:1981} ($\beta^2 = 0.913$), and $C_T = 9.115$.  The effective source strength and distance between the virtual source and target position is given by

\be Q_{f,C,eff} = Q_{I,2}^* \rho_\infty c_{p\infty} T_\infty \sqrt{g} Z_{I,2}^{5/2}  \ee

\be z_{eff} = z - Z_{I,1} + Z_{I,2} \ee
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:Plume_Temp_Notation}). The new values of the fire source and  target location are then used in the standard plume correlation where the ambient conditions are now those of the upper layer.

\end{figure}

\section{Flame Height}
\label{sec:firemassbalance}


CFAST includes a calculation of average flame height based on the work of Heskestad~\cite{Heskestad:2002}. Valid for a wide range of hydrocarbon and gaseous fuels, the correlation is given by
\be
   H = -1.02 D + 0.235 \brackets{\frac{Q_f}{1000}}^{2/5}
\ee
where $H$ is the average flame height (m), $D$ the diameter of the fire (m), and $\dQ$ is the total heat release rate (kW). The mean flame height is defined as the distance from the fuel source to the top of the visible flame where the intermittency is 0.5.  A flame intermittency of 0.5 means that the visible flame is above the mean 50 \% of the time and below the mean 50~\% of the time.  This average flame height is  included in the printed output from CFAST.







\chapter{Ventilation}

CFAST models three types of vent flow: natural flow through vertical vents (such as doors or windows),  natural flow through horizontal vents (such as ceiling holes or hatches), and forced flow via mechanical ventilation. Forced flow can occur through either vertical or horizontal vents.

Atmospheric pressure is about 100~kPa. Fires produce pressure changes from 1~Pa to 1~kPa and mechanical ventilation systems typically involve pressure differentials of about 1~Pa to 100~Pa.  The pressure variables are solved to a higher accuracy than other solution variables because of the subtraction (with resulting loss of precision) needed to calculate vent flows from pressure differences.


\section{Vertically-Oriented Vents (Doors and Windows)}

Natural flow through windows and doors is governed by the pressure difference across the opening.  A momentum equation for the zone boundaries is not solved directly.  Instead momentum transfer at the zone boundaries is included by using Bernoulli's equation augmented for restricted openings with an orifice coefficient~\cite{Quintiere:1984, Steckler_Coefficients}.

The mass flow through a vertical opening is calculated by dividing the vertical extent of the opening into discrete segments, each of which is bounded by either the top or bottom of the door or window, the zone interface of either compartment, or the neutral plane, which is where the velocity changes direction. In this way, the vent opening is partitioned into at most six sections.

Let $z=b$ and $z=t$ denote the height of the bottom and top of the segment, and $\Delta P_b$ and $\Delta P_t$ denote the pressure differences at those heights.  Because the segment is either completely above or completely below the neutral plane, the two pressure differences will have the same sign. The mass flow through the segment can then be computed by integrating from $b$ to $t$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\dm &=& \int_b^t C \sqrt{2 \rho \, \Delta P(z)} \, w \, dz  \\[.1in]
    &=& C\sqrt{2\rho} \, w \int_b^t\sqrt{\frac{|(t-z) \, \Delta P_b + (z-b) \, \Delta P_t|}{t-b}} \; dz \\[.1in]
    &=& \frac{2}{3} \, C \sqrt{2\rho} \, w \, (t-b)\frac{|\Delta P_t|^{3/2}-|\Delta P_b|^{3/2}}{|\Delta P_t|-|\Delta P_b|}
\label{eq:massflowone}
\end{eqnarray}
Here, $C$ is the orifice coefficient taken to be 0.7~\cite{Steckler_Coefficients}, $\rho$ is the gas density of the upwind compartment, and $\Delta P(z)$ is the pressure across the interface at elevation $z$. Note that the integral is evaluated from
\begin{eqnarray}
\int \sqrt{A+Bz} \, dz = \frac{2}{3B}(A+Bz)^{3/2}+\mbox{constant}
\end{eqnarray}
where $A=(|t\,\Delta P_t|-b\,|\Delta P_b|)/(t-b)$ and $B=(|\Delta P_t|-|\Delta P_b|)/(t-b)$.
Equation \ref{eq:massflowone} is sometimes written:
\be
   \dm = \frac{2}{3} C \sqrt{2 \rho} \, w \, (t-b)  \frac{|\Delta P_t|+\sqrt{|\Delta P_t \,\Delta P_b|}+|\Delta P_b|}{\sqrt{|\Delta P_t|}+\sqrt{|\Delta P_b|} }
\ee

The mass flows through the various vertical segments of the door or window are distributed into the upper and lower layers of the downstream compartment depending on the temperature of the stream. Consider the flow of gas from the upper layer of Compartment~1 entering the lower layer of Compartment~2 (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Flow_Patterns}).
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5.0in]{FIGURES/Theory/Flow_Patterns}\\
\end{center}
\caption{Flow patterns and layer number conventions for horizontal flow through a vertical vent.}
 \label{fig:Flow_Patterns}
\end{figure}
The mass flow rate is denoted $\dm_{14}$, where the subscripts indicate the upstream and downstream layer indices, respectively. The enthalpy flow rate is:
\be
   \doh_{14} = c_p \brackets{T_1-T_4} \dm_{14}
\ee
Assuming that $T_4 < T_1 < T_3$, this energy will be distributed between the compartments two layers. The distribution is based on the relative difference in temperature between the incoming gas stream and the layer temperatures. If $T_1$ is close to $T_3$, most of the energy will go to the upper layer 3 in the form of a virtual plume. The effective heat release rate of this virtual plume is:
\be
   \dQ_{\rm eff} = \frac{T_1-T_4}{T_3-T_4} \; \doh_{14}
\ee
The mass entrainment rate into this virtual plume at the midpoint of the vertical segment, $\bar{z}$, is:
\be
   \dm_{\rm e,eff}(\bar{z}-z_0) = \frac{T_1-T_4}{T_3-T_4} \; \dm_{14}
\ee
The origin of the virtual plume, $z_0$, is deduced from McCaffrey's entrainment correlation, Eq.~\ref{eq:McCaffreyPlume}. That is, $\bar{z}-z_0$ is the height above the base of the virtual fire whose HRR is $\dQ_{\rm eff}$ where the mass entrainment rate is $\dm_{\rm e,eff}$.

The other type of mixing is much like an inverse plume and causes contamination of the lower layer.  It occurs when there is flow of the type $\dm_{42} > 0$.  The shear flow causes vortex shedding into the lower layer and thus some of the particulates end up in the lower layer.  The actual amount of mass or energy transferred is usually not large, but its effect can be large.  For example, even minute amounts of carbon can change the radiative properties of the gas layer, from negligible to something finite.  It changes the rate of radiation absorption significantly and invalidates the simplification of an ambient temperature lower layer.  This term is predicated on the Kelvin-Helmholz flow instability and requires shear flow between two separate fluids.  The mixing is enhanced for greater density differences between the two layers. However, the amount of mixing has never been well characterized. Quintiere et al. \cite{Quintiere:1984} discuss this phenomena for the case of crib fires in a single room, but their correlation does not yield good agreement with experimental data in the general case \cite{Quintiere:1981}.  In the CFAST model, it is assumed that the incoming cold plume behaves like the inverse of the usual door jet between adjacent hot layers; thus we have a descending plume.  The same equations are used to calculate this inverse plume as are used for the upright door mixing, above. It is possible that the entrainment is overestimated in this case, since buoyancy, which is the driving force, is not nearly as strong as for the usually upright plume.

\section{Horizontally-Oriented Vents (Floor and Ceiling Vents)}

Flow through a ceiling or floor vent is governed by both pressure and density differences. The simplest form is uni-directional flow driven primarily by a relatively large pressure difference. When the pressure difference is relatively small, the density difference, where hot gas underlies colder gas, can lead to bi-directional flow where the gas in the lower compartment rises into the upper compartment and {\em vice versa}.  This situation might arise in a real fire if the room of origin suddenly has a hole open up in the ceiling.

Cooper's algorithm~\cite{Cooper:1989, Cooper:1990, Cooper:1995} is used for computing mass flow through ceiling and floor vents:
\be
   \dm = 0.1 \brackets{\frac{g \, \Delta \rho \, A_{\rm v}^{5/2}}{\rho_{\rm avg}}} \brackets{1 - \frac{2 \, A_{\rm v}^2 \, \Delta P}{S^2 \, g \, \Delta \rho \, D^5}}
\ee
where $D = 2 \sqrt{A_{\rm v} / \pi}$ and $S$ is 0.754 for round or 0.942 for square openings, respectively. For each layer on either side of the vent, there are two values of the mass flow, $\dm_{\rm in}$ and $\dm_{\rm out}$. These terms are symmetric: the outgoing flow from one compartment is the incoming flow to the other. The corresponding enthalpy flows are determined from the relative size and temperature of the lower and upper layers:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \doh_{\rm in} &=& c_p \, \dmu \, \Tu + c_p \, \dml \, \Tl \\[0.1in]
  \dmu &=& \dm_{\rm in} \, \frac{\Vu}{V} \\[0.1in]
  \dml &=& \dm_{\rm in} \, \frac{\Vl}{V}
\end{eqnarray}
The mass and energy are then deposited into the upper or lower layer of the receiving compartment based on the effective temperature of the incoming flow relative to the upper and lower layers of the receiving compartment. If the temperature of the incoming flow is higher than the temperature of the lower layer, then the flow is deposited into the upper layer. This is similar to the idea of using a virtual plume for a doorway flow.


\section{Forced Flow}

CFAST models mechanical ventilation in terms of user-specified volume flows at various points in the compartment. The model does not include duct work or fan curves. These equations are high-order, non-linear and in some cases ill-posed, which caused a great deal of difficulty in reaching a numerical solution.

Figure~\ref{fig:Fans_and_Ducts}(a) depicts smoke exhaust via a fan at the top of an atrium, and Fig.~\ref{fig:Fans_and_Ducts}(b) illustrates a kitchen exhaust fan.  Cross ventilation, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fans_and_Ducts}(c), is occasionally used without heating or cooling.  Generally systems that maintain comfort conditions have either one or two fans. Further information about these systems is presented in Klote and Milke~\cite{Klote:2002} and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) \cite{ASHRAE:2001}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5.0in]{FIGURES/Theory/HVAC_Fans_and_Ducts}\\
\end{center}
\caption{Some simple fan-duct systems.}
 \label{fig:Fans_and_Ducts}
\end{figure}

The flow through mechanical vents can be filtered. Filtering affects particulates such as smoke and the trace species. Filtering can be turned on at any time. Effectiveness is from 0~\% (no effect) to 100~\% which completely blocks flow of these two species.





\chapter{Heat Transfer}

This section discusses thermal radiation, convection and conduction, the three mechanisms by which heat is transferred between the gas layers and the enclosing compartment walls. Hot gases exchange heat with solid surfaces via convection and radiation. Heat is transferred through solids via conduction. Different material properties can be used for the ceiling, floor, and walls of each compartment (although all the walls of a compartment must be the same).  Additionally, each surface can be composed of up to three distinct layers.  This allows the user to deal naturally with the actual building construction.  Material thermophysical properties are assumed to be constant. Radiative transfer occurs among the fire(s), gas layers and compartment surfaces (ceiling, walls and floor).  This transfer is a function of the temperature differences and the emissivity of the gas layers as well as the compartment surfaces.  Typical surface emissivity values only vary over a small range.  For the gas layers, however, the emissivity is a function of the concentration of species which are strong radiators, predominately smoke particulates, carbon dioxide, and water.

\section{Radiation}
\label{sec:Radiation}

Radiation heat transfer is calculated between the ceiling, floor, wall layers, and fire, with the inclusion of emission and absorption by the hot gas layer~\cite{Forney_radiation}. The following assumptions are made:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each gas layer and each wall segment is assumed to be at a uniform temperature.
\item The wall and gas layer temperatures are assumed to change slowly over the duration of the time step of the governing equations.
\item The fire is assumed to radiate uniformly in all directions emitting a fraction, $\chi_{\rm r}$, of the total heat release rate.  This radiation is assumed to originate from a single point.  Radiation feedback to the fire and radiation from the plume is not modeled in the radiation exchange algorithm.
\item The radiation emitted is assumed to be diffuse and gray.  In other words, the radiant fluxes emitted are independent of direction and wavelength. At a solid surface, the emittance, $\epsilon$, absorptance, $\alpha$ and reflectance, $\rho$, are related via $\epsilon = \alpha = 1 - \rho$. In the gas phase, the emittance, $\epsilon$, absorptance, $\alpha$ and transmittance, $\tau$, are related via $\epsilon = \alpha = 1 - \tau$.
\item Rooms or compartments are assumed to be rectangular boxes.  Each wall is either perpendicular or parallel to every other wall.  Radiation transfer through vent openings is lost from the room.
\end{itemize}
The compartment lining is divided into four parts: the ceiling, the floor, and the wall sections above and below the layer interface. The net radiative heat flux at surface~$k$, $\dq_k''$, is found by solving the simplified radiation transport equation~\cite{SiegelandHowell:1981}:
\be
   \frac{\dq_k''}{\epsilon_k} - \displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^N \frac{1 - \epsilon_j}{\epsilon_j} \, \dq_j'' \, F_{k-j} \, \tau_{k-j} = \sigma T_k^4 - \displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^N \brackets{\sigma T_j^4 \, F_{k-j} \, \tau_{k-j}} - c_k \label{RTE}
\ee
where $F_{k-j}$ is the configuration factor (fraction of radiant energy emitted by surface $j$ that is intercepted by surface $k$), $\tau_{k-j}$ is the transmittance, $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzman constant, $\epsilon_k$ is the emissivity, $A_k$ is the area, and $T_k$ is the temperature of surface $k$. The radiation from the hot gas layer and the fire is included in the last term:
\be
   c_k = \epsilon_{\rm u} \, F_{{\rm u}-k} \, \sigma \, \Tu^4 + \frac{\omega_{{\rm f}-k}}{4 \pi} \frac{\chi_{\rm r} \, \dQ}{A_k}
\ee
where $\epsilon_{\rm u}$ is the emittance (absorptance) of the upper layer, $F_{{\rm u}-k}$ is the view factor between the upper layer and solid surface, $\omega_{{\rm f}-k}$ is the solid angle between the fire and wall\footnote{Note that as the area of surface $k$ shrinks to zero, $\omega_{{\rm f}-k}/A_k \to 1/R^2$, yielding the classic point source radiation model}, and $\dQ$ is the heat release rate of the fire. If the solid surface, $k$, is the floor or the lower wall, the view factor refers to the layer interface. If the solid surface, is the upper wall or ceiling, the view factor is 1.

\subsubsection{Configuration Factors}

The configuration factor, $F_{1-2}$, is the fraction of radiant energy emitted by surface 1 that is intercepted by  surface 2, and is calculated:
\be
   F_{1-2} = \frac{1}{A_1} \int_{A_1} \int_{A_2} \frac{\cos \theta_1 \, \cos \theta_2}{\pi L^2} \, dA_2 \, dA_1 \label{eq:config_factor}
\ee
where $L$ is the distance along the line of integration,  $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the angles for surface 1 and 2 between the respective normal vectors and the line of integration, and $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the areas of the two surfaces.  These terms are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:Rad_Config_Factor}.  When the surfaces $A_1$ and $A_2$ are far apart relative to their surface area, eq (\ref{eq:config_factor}) can be approximated by assuming that $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$ and $L$ are constant over the region of integration to obtain

 \label{fig:Rad_Config_Factor}

\be
   F_{1-2} = \frac{\cos \theta_1 \, \cos \theta_2}{\pi L^2} A_2
\ee

\subsubsection{Transmittance and Absorptance}

The transmittance is the fraction of radiant energy that will pass through a volume filled with an absorbing media. It is usually expressed in the form:
\be
   \tau = {\rm e}^{-a L}
\ee
where $a$ is the absorption coefficient and $L$ is the path length. The absorptance is the fraction of radiant energy absorbed by that volume. For a gray gas, $\alpha + \tau = 1$.

In general, the transmittance and absorptance are functions of wavelength. This is an important factor to consider for the major gaseous products, $\textnormal{CO}_2$  and $\textnormal{H}_2 \textnormal{O}$. However soot has a continuous absorption spectrum that allows the transmittance and absorptance to be approximated as ``gray'' \cite{SiegelandHowell:1981} across the entire spectrum. The total transmittance over a path length $L$ through a volume of combustion products is taken as the product of the transmittance of the soot and major product gases:
\be
   \tau = e^{-a_{\rm s}L} \brackets{1 - \alpha_{\rm H_2O} - 0.5 \alpha_{\rm CO_2}}
\ee
The factor of 0.5 applied to the absorptance of CO$_2$ accounts for the overlap of the wavelength bands of the two gases. Tien~et~al.~\cite{Tien:2002} suggest that the absorption coefficient for soot may be approximated $a_{\rm s} = k f_v T$ where $k$ is a constant that depends on the optical properties of the soot particles, $f_v$ is the soot volume fraction, and $T$ is the (absolute) temperature. Values of $k$, have been found to be about constant for a wide range of fuels~\cite{Tien:1978}.

Absorptance data for $\textnormal{H}_2 \textnormal{O}$ and $\textnormal{CO}_2$ are reported in Ref.~\cite{Edwards:1985}. For each gas, these data are tabulated in a look-up table, implemented as a two-dimensional array based on temperature and gas concentration.

The effective path length, $L$, for the upper gas layer is approximated to be 1.8 times its depth~\cite{Tien:2002}.




\section{Convection}

The transfer of heat between the gas and solid surfaces is handled slightly differently at the ceiling, floor and walls, due to the difference in orientation and the presence of a relatively thin hot flow near the ceiling known as the ceiling jet. The following two sections describe how the convective heat transfer is done for these different surfaces.

\subsection{Walls and Floor}

In general, the convective heat flux to a solid surface is given by:
\be
   \dqc'' = h \, \brackets{\Tg - \Ts}  \label{convective_heat_flux}
\ee
The convective heat transfer coefficient, $h$, is a function of the gas properties, temperature, and velocity. In CFAST, simple correlations for natural convection are used since the gas velocity is unknown:
\be
   h = C {|\Tg - \Ts|}^{1/3}
\ee
where $C$ is an empirical coefficient (1.52 for the floor and ceiling (in the absence of a ceiling jet) and 1.31 for the walls~\cite{Holman:1990}), $\Tg$ is the average gas layer temperature adjacent to the surface, and $\Ts$ is the surface temperature.

\subsection{Ceiling}

During the early stage of a fire before a hot gas layer has formed, the convective heat transfer to the ceiling is governed by the temperature and velocity of the ceiling jet. Alpert's chapter in the {\em SFPE Handbook}~\cite{Alpert:SFPE} presents an empirical correlation for the convective heat flux from the ceiling jet to a relatively cool surface:
\be 
   \dqc'' = 1.323 \, f \, \frac{\dQ_{\rm c}}{H^2} \, \left( \frac{r}{H} \right)^{-1.36}  \label{eq:cjflux}
\ee
where $f$ is a friction factor estimated to be 0.03, $r$ is the radial distance to the plume centerline, $H$ is the ceiling height, and $\dQ_{\rm c}$ is the convective fraction of the heat release rate. The average convective heat flux to the ceiling can be obtained by integrating this expression over the entire ceiling:
\be 
   \dq_{\rm c,avg}'' = \frac{1}{LW} \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^R \dqc'' \, r \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{0.27 \, \dQ_{\rm c}}{(LW)^{0.68} \, H^{0.64}} \label{eq:cjfluxavg}
\ee
Note that the integration is carried out over a circle whose area, $\pi R^2$, is equal to the area of the ceiling, $LW$. 

Equation~(\ref{eq:cjfluxavg}) applies to the early stage of the fire; thus, a modified heat transfer coefficient is used so that there is a transition from the early to later stages when a layer has formed:
\be
   h = \max \left( \frac{\dq_{\rm c,avg}''}{\Tu-\Ts} \, , \, C {|\Tu - \Ts|}^{1/3} \right)
\ee
Here, $\Tu$ is the average temperature of the upper layer and $\Ts$ is the ceiling surface temperature. Notice that the rightmost term is simply the correlation used for the walls and floor.

\section{Conduction}

The heat conduction equation is solved in the direction normal to solid target or wall surfaces using non-uniformly spaced nodes and a second order accurate central difference scheme for the spatial derivatives and a semi-implicit time marching scheme. At each time step, the internal solid temperatures are updated in time until the net convective and radiative heat flux striking the wall equals with the heat flux into the solid~\cite{Moss:1992}:
\be
   \dq'' \equiv \dqr'' + \dqc'' = -k \, \frac{dT}{dx} \Big|_{x=0}
\ee
where $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the solid.  This solution strategy requires a differential algebraic equation (DAE) solver that can simultaneously solve both differential and algebraic equations.  With this method, only one or two extra equations are required per wall segment (two if both the interior and exterior wall segment surface temperatures are computed).  This solution strategy is more efficient than the method of lines since fewer equations need to be solved. Conduction is then coupled to the gas phase energy exchange.

A non-uniform array of internal nodes is used to capture steep gradients in temperature near the surface. Define a penetration depth of
\be
   x_p = 2 \sqrt{\alpha \, t_{\rm end}} \; \hbox{erfc}^{-1} \brackets{0.05}
\ee
where $\hbox{erfc}^{-1}$ denotes the inverse of the complementary error function. The value $x_p$ is the location in a semi-infinite wall where the temperature rise is 5~\% after $t_{\rm end}$ seconds. Eighty percent of the nodes are placed on the interior side of $x_p$ and the remaining 20~\% are placed on the exterior side.

The heat conduction equation normal to the solid surface is:
\be \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{k}{\rho c}\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}
\label{eq:Target_PDE} \ee
where $k$, $\rho$ and $c$ are the thermal conductivity, density and heat capacity of the target. At the surface, $x=0$, the boundary condition is:
\be
   \dq''=-k\frac{dT}{dx} \label{eq:Target_Fourier}
\ee
where $\dq''$ is the net convective and radiative heat flux.

\newcommand{\Dt}{\Delta t}
\newcommand{\Dr}{\Delta r}
\newcommand{\Tipo}{T_{i+1}^{n+1}}
\newcommand{\Ti}{T_{i}^{n+1}}
\newcommand{\Timo}{T_{i-1}^{n+1}}

The 1-D heat conduction equation can be solved in either Cartesian or cylindrical coordinates. The solution methodology shall be presented for cylindrical coordinates:
\be \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{k}{\rho c} \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r \frac{\partial T}{\partial r} \right)
\label{eq:Target_PDE} \ee
Dividing the cylinder into $N$ uniformly spaced concentric control volumes, this equation can be written in discretized form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\Ti-T_i^n&=& \frac{\Dt}{\Dr} \frac{k}{\rho c}
\left[
\left(\frac{\Tipo-\Ti}{\Dr}\right)
\frac{r_i}{r_{i-1/2}}-
\left(\frac{\Ti-\Timo}{\Dr}\right)
\frac{r_{i-1}}{r_{i-1/2}}
\right]
\nonumber\\[0.2in]
&=&\frac{\Dt \, \alpha}{\Dr^2}
\left[
\left(\Tipo-\Ti\right)
\left(\frac{i}{i-0.5}\right)-
\left(\Ti-\Timo\right)
\left(\frac{i-1}{i-0.5}\right)
\right]
\label{eq:cylheat6}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha=k/(\rho c)$. Defining $C_i$ and $D_i$ as
\be
C_i = \frac{\alpha\Dt}{\Dr^2}\left(\frac{i-1}{i-0.5}\right) \quad ; \quad D_i = \frac{\alpha\Dt}{\Dr^2}\left(\frac{i}{i-0.5}\right)
\ee
Eq.~(\ref{eq:cylheat6}) can be written:
\be
-C_i \, \Timo + \left( 1+2\frac{\alpha\Dt}{\Dr^2} \right) \, \Ti - D_i \, \Tipo = T_i^n  \quad \quad i=1...N-1
\label{eq:cylheat8}
\ee
The boundary condition is applied at control volume $N$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
T_N^{n+1}-T_N^n=\frac{\alpha\Dt}{\Dr^2}
\left[\frac{\Dr \, \dq''}{k} \frac{N}{N-0.5} -(T_N^{n+1}-T_{N-1}^{n+1}) \frac{N-1}{N-0.5} \right]
\end{eqnarray*}
or
\be
-C_N \, T_{N-1}^{n+1}+ \left( 1+C_N \right) T_N^{n+1} = T_N^n+D_N\frac{\Dr}{k} \dq''
\label{eq:cylheat10}
\ee
The internal temperature profile, $T_i$, is then obtained with a tri-diagonal linear solver.




\section{Coupling the Gas and Solid Phase Calculations}

To illustrate the method, consider a one room case with one active wall.  There are four gas equations (pressure, upper layer volume, upper layer temperature, and lower layer temperature) and one wall temperature equation.  Implementation of the gradient matching method requires that storage be allocated for the temperature profile at the previous time, t, and at the next time, $t + \Delta t$.  Given the profile at time t and values for the five unknowns at time $t + \Delta t$ (initial guess by the solver), the temperature profile is advanced from time t to time $t + \Delta t$.  The temperature gradient at $x = 0$ is computed followed by the residuals for the five equations.  The DAE solver adjusts the solution variables and the time step until the residuals for all the equations are below an error tolerance.  Once the solver has completed the step, the array storing the temperature profile for the previous time is updated, and the DAE solver is ready to take its next step.

Heat transfer between connected compartments is modeled by merging the back surfaces of the connected ceiling and floor of the compartments or the back wall surfaces of the connected horizontal compartments.  A heat conduction problem is solved for the merged walls using a temperature boundary condition for both the near and far wall.  As before, temperatures are determined by the DAE solver so that the heat flux striking the wall surface (both interior and exterior) is consistent with the temperature gradient at that surface.

For horizontal heat transfer between compartments, the connections may be between partial wall surfaces, expressed as a fraction of the wall surface. CFAST first estimates conduction fractions analogous to radiative configuration factors.    For example, if only one half of the rear wall in one compartment is adjacent to the front wall in a second compartment, the conduction fraction between the two compartments is 1/2.   Once these fractions are determined, an average flux, $\dq_{\rm avg}''$, is calculated using
\be
   \dq_{\rm avg}'' = \sum_{\rm walls} \, F_{ij} \dq_j''
\ee
where $F_{ij}$ is the fraction of flux from wall $i$ that contributes to wall $j$, $\dq_j''$ is the flux striking wall $j$.

\section{Sprinkler and Heat Detector Activation}

The link temperature of a sprinkler or heat detector is modeled using the differential equation~\cite{Heskestad:1976}:
\be
   \frac{d \TL}{dt} = \frac{\sqrt{v}}{\rm RTI} \brackets{\Tg - \TL}  \label{eq:RTI}
\ee
where $\TL$ and $\Tg$ are the link and gas temperatures, $v$ is the ceiling jet velocity, and RTI (Response Time Index) is a measure of the sensor's thermal inertia. The gas temperature and velocity obtained from the ceiling jet algorithm, described below. Rooms without fires do not have ceiling jets, in which case the upper layer temperature is used, along with a fixed velocity of 0.12~m/s. The link and gas temperatures and the velocity are functions of time; the RTI is a constant for a given detector type. The detector equation is solved numerically using the semi-implicit updating scheme:
\be
   \frac{\TL^{n+1}-\TL^n}{\delta t} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{v^n}}{\rm RTI} \brackets{\Tg^n - \TL^n}  + \frac{\sqrt{v^{n+1}}}{\rm RTI} \brackets{\Tg^{n+1} - \TL^{n+1}}  \right) \label{eq:RTI_rewritten}
\ee
where the superscript $n$ denotes the value at the current time, and $\delta t$ is the time step.

The local gas velocity and temperature are estimated assuming the ceiling jet is immersed in a hot gas layer. From the work of Cooper \cite{Cooper:1990b}:
\be
   \frac{v_{cj}}{v_{max}} = \left\{ \begin{array}{r@{\quad \quad}l}
  \brackets{\zdel}^{1/7}\brackets{8-\zdel}/7 &  0 \leq \zdel<1 \\[.1in]
   \cosh{\brackets{c_r \brackets{\zdel-1}}}^2 &  1 \leq \zdel \end{array} \right.
\ee

\be
  \Theta = \frac{T_{CJ}-T_U}{T_{max}-T_U}= \left\{ \begin{array}{r@{\quad \quad}l}
   \Theta_s+ 2 \brackets{1-\Theta_s}\zdel - \brackets{1-\Theta_s}\brackets{\zdel}^2 &  0 \leq \zdel<1 \\[.1in]
   \frac{v_{cj}}{v_{max}} &  1 \leq \zdel \end{array} \right.
\ee
where $v_{max}=0.85\brackets{r/H}^{-1.1}\sqrt{gH}\sqrt[3]{Q_H^*}$, $Q_H^*= \dQ/\brackets{\rho_U c_p T_U \sqrt{gH} H^2}$, $\delta/H=0.1\brackets{r/H}^{0.9}$, $c_r=\frac{0.23}{0.77}\log{\brackets{\sqrt{2}-1}}$, $T_{max}=T_U + 2.6\brackets{1-\lambda_c}\brackets{r/H}^{-4/5}\brackets{Q_H^*}^{2/3}T_U - 0.09 \brackets{T_s-T_U}$, and $\lambda_c$ is the fraction of the fire's heat release transferred by convection to the ceiling from the point of impingement to $r$, evaluated numerically. If the detector or sprinkler is outside the ceiling jet layer or in a compartment without a fire, the appropriate gas layer temperature and a default velocity of 0.1 m/s is used.

\section{Fire Suppression} \label{sec:suppression}

Fire suppression by water is predicted using a simple empirical model developed by Madrzykowski \cite{Madrzykowski:1992} and Evans~\cite{Evans:1993}. After activation of the sprinkler, $t > t_{\rm act}$, the heat release rate is assumed to decrease exponentially:
\be
   \dQ(t) = \dQ(t_{\rm act}) \; {\rm e}^{-(t-t_{\rm act}) /\tau}   \quad ; \quad \tau = 3 u_{\rm w}^{-1.8}
\ee
where $u_{\rm w}$ is the water spray density, expressed in units of m/s. The product species mass production rates are reduced by the same amount as the heat release rate.

There are assumptions and limitations in this approach. Its main deficiency is that it assumes that sufficient water is applied to the fire to cause a decrease in the rate of heat release. This suppression model cannot handle the case when the fire overwhelms the sprinkler.  The suppression model as implemented does not include the effect of a second sprinkler. Detection of all sprinklers are noted but their activation does not make the fire go out any faster. Further, multiple fires in a room imply multiple ceiling jets. It is not clear how the two ceiling jets should interact. When there is more than one fire, the detection algorithm uses the fire that results in the highest ceiling jet temperature in order to calculate the sprinkler link temperature.

\section{Species Concentration and Deposition}

CFAST uses a combustion chemistry scheme based on a carbon-hydrogen-oxygen balance.  The scheme is applied in three places.  The first is burning in the portion of the plume which is in the lower layer of the compartment of fire origin.  The second is the portion in the upper layer, also in the compartment of origin.  The third is in the vent flow which entrains air from a lower layer into an upper layer in an adjacent compartment.  Included in the combustion calculation is the generation and transport of a number of species that may be produced by a fire.  These species include unburned fuel, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, carbon (assumed to be soot produced by the fire), hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen chloride, and an arbitrary trace species.

\subsection{Species Transport}

The species transport in CFAST is primarily a matter of bookkeeping to track individual species mass as it is generated by a fire, transported through vents, or mixed between layers in a compartment.  When the layers are initialized at the start of the simulation, they are set to ambient conditions.  These are the initial temperature prescribed by the user, and 23 \% by mass fraction (21 \% by volume fraction) oxygen, 77 \% by mass fraction (79 \% by volume fraction) nitrogen, a mass concentration of water prescribed by the user as a relative humidity, and a zero concentration of all other species.  As fuel is burned, the various species are produced in direct relation to the mass of fuel burned (this relation is the species yields prescribed by the user for the fuel burning).  Since oxygen is consumed rather than produced by the burning, the `yield' of oxygen is negative, and is set internally to correspond to the amount of oxygen used to burn the fuel (within the constraint of available oxygen limits discussed in sec. \ref{sec:Oxygen_Limit}). Two special separate species calculations are included in the model, a time-integrated value for a generic toxic species, Ct, and an arbitrary trace species, TS.  Both are assumed not to be part of the overall mass balance, but are rather generated by a fire and transported through a structure in a manner identical to other species.

Each unit mass of a species produced by a fire is carried in the flow to the various rooms and accumulates in the layers.  The model keeps track of the mass of each species in each layer, and knows the volume of each layer as a function of time.  The mass divided by the volume is the mass concentration, which along with the relative molecular mass gives the concentration in volume percent or parts per million as appropriate. Filters can be used in mechanical ventilation systems to remove species. The phenomenon has been implemented in CFAST to remove trace species and soot. It is implemented by modifying the source terms which describe gas flow. Mass that is filtered remains on the filter and is removed from the air stream. Both the resulting species density and total species removed can be analyzed. See reference \cite{Jones:2008} for an example on the use of filtering.

The calculation of radiation exchange in CFAST also depends in part on the species concentrations calculated by the model (and thus the user inputs for species yields). There are two separate radiation calculations done by CFAST. The first is for broadband radiation transfer for energy balance. The way this calculation is done is discussed in section \ref{sec:Radiation}. The second is a visible light calculation to answer the question of whether exit signs will be visible. The absorption of broadband radiation depends on the concentration of water, carbon dioxide and soot. The visibility calculation depends solely on the soot concentration For soot, the input for soot yield  assumes all the excess carbon goes to soot). This soot generation is then transported as a species to yield a soot mass concentration to use in the optical density calculation based originally on the work of Seader and Einhorn \cite{Seader:1976}. The most recent work is by Mulholland and Croakin\cite{Mullholland:2000}. Based on their experimental measurements, the soot mass density is multiplied by 3,817 m\superscript{2}/kg (formerly 3,500 m\superscript{2}/kg) to obtain an optical density (in units of m\superscript{-1}) which is the value reported by the model.

\subsection{HCl Deposition}\label{HClDeposition}

Hydrogen chloride produced in a fire can produce a strong irritant reaction that can impair escape from the fire.  It has been shown \cite{Galloway:1989} that significant amounts of the substance may be removed by adsorption by surfaces which contact smoke.  In our model, HCl production is treated in a manner similar to other species.  However, an additional term is required to allow for deposition on, and subsequent absorption into, material surfaces.

The physical configuration that we are modeling is a gas layer adjacent to a surface (Fig.~\ref{fig:HCl_Deposition}).  The gas layer is at some temperature $T_g$ with a concomitant density of hydrogen chloride, $\rho_{HCl}$.  The mass transport coefficient is calculated based on the Reynolds analogy with mass and heat transfer; that is, hydrogen chloride is mass being moved convectively in the boundary layer, and some of it simply sticks to the wall surface rather than completing the journey during the convective roll-up associated with eddy diffusion in the boundary layer.  The boundary layer at the wall is then in equilibrium with the wall.  The latter is a statistical process and is determined by evaporation from the wall and stickiness of the wall for HCl molecules.  This latter is greatly influenced by the concentration of water in the gas, in the boundary layer and on the wall itself.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5.0in]{FIGURES/Theory/HCl_Deposition}\\
\end{center}
\caption{Schematic of hydrogen chloride deposition region.}
 \label{fig:HCl_Deposition}
\end{figure}

The rate of addition of mass of hydrogen chloride to the gas layer is given by

\be \frac{d}{dt} m_{HCl} = source - k_c \brackets{\rho_{HCl} - \rho_{bl-HCl}} A_w \ee
where source is the production rate from the burning object plus flow from other compartments. For the wall concentration, the rate of addition is

\be \frac{d}{dt} d_{w-HCl} = k_c \brackets{\rho_{HCl} - \rho_{bl-HCl}} - k_s m_{w-HCl} \ee
where the concentration in the boundary layer, $\rho_{bl-HCl}$  is related to the wall surface concentration by the equilibrium constant $k_e$, by the relation $\rho_{bl-HCl} = d_{w-HCl} / k_e$. We never actually solve for the concentration in the boundary layer, but it is available, as is a boundary layer temperature if it were of interest.  The transfer coefficients are

\be k_c = \frac{\dot{q}}{\Delta T \rho_g c_p} \ee
\be k_e = \frac{b_1 e^{1500/T_w}}{1 + b_2 e^{1500/T_w} \rho_{HCl}} \brackets{1 + \frac{b_5 \brackets{\rho_{H_2O}}^{b_6}}{\brackets{\rho_{H_2O,sat} - \rho_{H_2O,g}}^{b_7}} } \ee
\be k_s = b_3 e^{-\brackets{\frac{b_4}{R T_w}}} \ee

The only values currently available  for these quantities are shown in table \ref{tab:HCL_Deposition} \cite{Galloway:1990}.  The ``$b$'' coefficients are parameters which are found by fitting experimental data to the above equations. These coefficients reproduce the adsorption and absorption of HCl reasonably well.  Note though that error bars for these coefficients have not been reported in the literature.

The experimental basis for poly(methyl methacrylate) and gypsum cover a sufficiently wide range of conditions that they should be usable in a variety of practical situations.  The parameters for the other surfaces do not have much experimental backing, and so their use should be limited to comparison purposes.

\section{Single Zone Approximation}

A single zone approximation is appropriate for smoke flow far from a fire source where the two-zone layer stratification is less pronounced than in compartments near the fire. In this situation, a single zone approximation may be derived by using the normal two-zone source terms and the substitutions:

\be
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{m}_U^{new} &=& \dot{m}_L + \dot{m}_U \\
\dot{m}_L^{new} &=& 0 \\
Q_U^{new} &=& Q_L + Q_U \\
Q_L^{new} &=& 0
\end{array}
\ee

This is used in situations where the stratification does not occur. Examples are elevators shafts, complex stairwells, natural venting ductwork, and compartments far from the fire.
