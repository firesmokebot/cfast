C     Description:  Interface between RESID and the conduction calculation.
C                   For each active wall surface in each routine this
C                   routine calculates the residual function 
C                   q'' + K dT/dx, which when zero is simply Fourier's
C                   law of heat conduction.
C
C     Arguments: UPDATE  We don't keep solution unless UPDATE is 1 or 2
C                        If UPDATE is 2 then we don't calculate DELTA or
C                        use FLXTOT
C                DT Time step interval from last valid solution point
C                FLXTOT  Total flux striking walls
C                DELTA   The residual of q'' + K DT/dx

C        Created:  by GPF
C        Modified: 2/5/93 BY GPF
C                  added partial derivative calculations for the
C                  reduced Jacobian option
C        Modified: 2/25/94 BY GPF
C                  added external temperature to CNDUCT call for
C                  the room to room heat transfer option
C        Modified by GPF 10/10/94
C               Added fourth boundary condition option, flux on both
C               sides of wall.  This is needed when we do a full 
C               numerical conduction calculation of targets.  Currently,
C               we assume that targets are thin surfaces, ie we calculate
C               a temperature that results in a net flux of zero
C               striking the target.
C        Modified by GPF 4/26/95
C               Removed ETA from CNDUCT's argument list
C        Modified by GPF 7/13/95
C               Reduced the number of conduction calculations performed during
C               a Jacobian calculation (OPTION(FMODJAC)==2)
C        Modified by GPF 2/5/96   removed reduced jacobian option added on 2/5/93.
