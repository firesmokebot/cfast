!     routine: chemie
!     purpose: do the combustion chemistry - for plumes in both the upper and lower layers.
!         note that the kinetics scheme is implemented here.  however, applying it to the
!         various pieces, namely the lower layer plume, the upper layer plume, and the door jet fires, is 
!         somewhat complex.

!         care should be exercised in making changes either here or in the source interface routine.

!     arguments:  pyrolysis_rate: calculated pyrolysis rate of the fuel (kg/s)
!                 molar_mass: molar mass of the fuel (kg/mol)
!                 entrainment_rate: calculated entrainment rate (kg/s)
!                 source_room: compartment that contains this fire
!                 h_c: heat of combustion of the fuel (W/kg)
!                 y_soot, y_co, y_trace: species yields for soot, CO, and trace species; others are calculated from the molecular formula of the fuel (kg species produced/kg fuel pyrolyzed)
!                 n_C, n_H, n_O, n_N, n_Cl: molecular formula for the fuel; these can be fractional; yields of O2, HCl, and HCN are determined from this
!                 source_o2, lower_o2_limit: oxygen concentration in the source layer of the compartment; lower oxygen limit for combustion (as a fraction)
!                 activated_room: if zero, a sprinkler has gone off in this compartment.  If equal to the source room, HRR is saved for future quenching
!                 activated_sprinkler: sprinkler that has activated
!                 activated_time: time of sprinkler activaiton (s)
!                 activated_rate: sprinkler suppression rate
!                 model_time: current simulation time (s)

!                 hrr_at_activation (output): saved hrr in case of future activation (W)
!                 hrr_constrained (output): actual HRR of the fire constrained by available oxygen (W)
!                 pyrolysis_rate_constrained (output): actual pyrolysis rate of the fuel constrained by available oxygen (kg/s)
!                 species_rates (output): production rates of species based on calculated yields and constrained pyrolysis rate (kg/s); fuel and oxygen are naturally negative
