C*RB
C     Routine:  DJFIRE
C
C     Function: Calculate heat and combustion chemistry for a door jet
C               fire.
C
C     Inputs:   ITO     Room number door jet is flowing into
C               TJET    Temperature of the door jet gas
C               XXNETFL Net fuel available to be burned
C               SAS     Mass flow rate of entrained air in door jet
C               HCOMBT  Heat of combustion of unburned fuel
C     Outputs:  QPYROL  Total heat released by door jet fire
C               XNTMS   Net change in mass of species in door jet

C                  Implement fast startup option.  Execute this routine only if this 
C                  modeling feature is being used (rather than zeroing out 
C                  the flow vector.)
C     RDP   4/8/94    moved summing of species production rates from CHEMIE
C                     to calling routine.
C     gpf 10/14/93   In DOFIRE, the routine CHEMIE requires info about
C                    fire size for sprinkler option.  Though a door jet
C                    fire is not attenuated by sprinklers, the call
C                    to CHEMIE had to made consistent with call in
C                    dofire.
