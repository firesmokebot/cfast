C     Routine:     CONVEC

C     Functional Class:  CFAST
C
C     Description:  Calculate convective heat transfer for a wall segment
C                   Note that we have simplified the convection calculation
C                   by assuming turbulent flow.  This allows us to remove the
C                   dependency on the characterisitic length and avoid a divide
C                   by zero as the surface vanishes.  If a more general
C                   relationship is desired, the code will have to be reworked
C                   to include the characteristic length in the calculation.
C
C     Arguments: IW     Wall number, standand CFAST numbering convention
C                TG     Temperature of gas layer adjacent to wall surface
C                TW     Wall surface temperature
C                QDINL  Convective flux into wall surface IW

C     Revision History:
C        Created:  by WWJ
C        Modified: 1/2/1987 at 16:19 by WWJ:
C                  change number of surfaces to be consistent with four-wall 
C                  numbering. QDINAL is now multiplied by (TG-TW). This was 
C                  missing.
C        Modified: 1/4/1993 at 16:20 by RDP & GPF:
C                  changed calculation to be consistent with SPFE Handbook 
C                  chapter on convective heat transfer. Calculation of thermal 
C                  properties and correlations come from there.  Smooth
C                  transition between correlations added with TANH.  
C                  Vertical tangent in Nusselt number was eliminated (when
C                  gas and wall temperatures are close) in order to improve
C                  numerical characteristics.  Note this has little effect
C                  on flux calculation.
