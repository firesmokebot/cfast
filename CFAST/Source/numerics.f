C
C
C
C *Arguments:
C
C  RES:EXT  This is a subroutine which you provide to define the
C           differential/algebraic system.
C
C  NEQ:IN  This is the number of equations to be solved.
C
C  T:INOUT  This is the current value of the independent variable.
C
C  Y(*):INOUT  This array contains the solution components at T.
C
C  YPRIME(*):INOUT  This array contains the derivatives of the solution
C                   components at T.
C
C  TOUT:IN  This is a point at which a solution is desired.
C
C  INFO(N):IN  The basic task of the code is to solve the system from T
C              to TOUT and return an answer at TOUT.  INFO is an integer
C              array which is used to communicate exactly how you want
C              this task to be carried out.  N must be greater than or
C              equal to 15.
C
C  RTOL,ATOL:INOUT  These quantities represent absolute and relative
C                   error tolerances which you provide to indicate how
C                   accurately you wish the solution to be computed.
C                   You may choose them to be both scalars or else
C                   both vectors.
C
C  IDID:OUT  This scalar quantity is an indicator reporting what the
C            code did.  You must monitor this integer variable to decide
C            what action to take next.
C
C  RWORK:WORK  A real work array of length LRW which provides the
C               code with needed storage space.
C
C  LRW:IN  The length of RWORK.

C               code with needed storage space.
C
C  LIW:IN  The length of IWORK.
C
C  RPAR,IPAR:IN  These are real and integer parameter arrays which
C                you can use for communication between your calling
C                program and the RES subroutine (and the JAC subroutine)
C
C  JAC:EXT  This is the name of a subroutine which you may choose to
C           provide for defining a matrix of partial derivatives
C           described below.

C
C *Description
C  QUANTITIES WHICH MAY BE ALTERED BY THE CODE ARE
C     T,Y(*),YPRIME(*),INFO(1),RTOL,ATOL,
C     IDID,RWORK(*) AND IWORK(*)
C
C  Subroutine DDASSL uses the backward differentiation formulas of
C  orders one through five to solve a system of the above form for Y and
C  YPRIME.  Values for Y and YPRIME at the initial time must be given as
C  input.  These values must be consistent, (that is, if T,Y,YPRIME are
C  the given initial values, they must satisfy G(T,Y,YPRIME) = 0.).  The
C  subroutine solves the system from T to TOUT.  It is easy to continue
C  the solution to get results at additional TOUT.  This is the interval
C  mode of operation.  Intermediate results can also be obtained easily
C  by using the intermediate-output capability.
C
C  ----------INPUT-WHAT TO DO ON THE FIRST CALL TO DDASSL---------------
C
C
C  The first call of the code is defined to be the start of each new
C  problem. Read through the descriptions of all the following items,
C  provide sufficient storage space for designated arrays, set
C  appropriate variables for the initialization of the problem, and
C  give information about how you want the problem to be solved.
C
C
C  RES -- Provide a subroutine of the form
C             SUBROUTINE RES(T,Y,YPRIME,DELTA,IRES,RPAR,IPAR)
C         to define the system of differential/algebraic
C         equations which is to be solved. For the given values
C         of T,Y and YPRIME, the subroutine should
C         return the residual of the defferential/algebraic
C         system
C             DELTA = G(T,Y,YPRIME)
C         (DELTA(*) is a vector of length NEQ which is
C         output for RES.)
C
C         Subroutine RES must not alter T,Y or YPRIME.
C         You must declare the name RES in an external
C         statement in your program that calls DDASSL.
C         You must dimension Y,YPRIME and DELTA in RES.
C
C         IRES is an integer flag which is always equal to
C         zero on input. Subroutine RES should alter IRES
C         only if it encounters an illegal value of Y or
C         a stop condition. Set IRES = -1 if an input value
C         is illegal, and DDASSL will try to solve the problem
C         without getting IRES = -1. If IRES = -2, DDASSL
C         will return control to the calling program
C         with IDID = -11.
C
C         RPAR and IPAR are real and integer parameter arrays which
C         you can use for communication between your calling program
C         and subroutine RES. They are not altered by DDASSL. If you
C         do not need RPAR or IPAR, ignore these parameters by treat-
C         ing them as dummy arguments. If you do choose to use them,
C         dimension them in your calling program and in RES as arrays
C         of appropriate length.
C
C  NEQ -- Set it to the number of differential equations.
C         (NEQ >= 1)
C
C  T -- Set it to the initial point of the integration.
C       T must be defined as a variable.
C
C  Y(*) -- Set this vector to the initial values of the NEQ solution
C          components at the initial point. You must dimension Y of
C          length at least NEQ in your calling program.
C
C  YPRIME(*) -- Set this vector to the initial values of
C               the NEQ first derivatives of the solution
C               components at the initial point. You
C               must dimension YPRIME at least NEQ
C               in your calling program. If you do not
C               know initial values of some of the solution
C               components, see the explanation of INFO(11).
C
C  TOUT - Set it to the first point at which a solution
C         is desired. You can not take TOUT = T.
C         integration either forward in T (TOUT > T) or
C         backward in T (TOUT < T) is permitted.
C
C         The code advances the solution from T to TOUT using
C         step sizes which are automatically selected so as to
C         achieve the desired accuracy. If you wish, the code will
C         return with the solution and its derivative at
C         intermediate steps (intermediate-output mode) so that
C         you can monitor them, but you still must provide TOUT in
C         accord with the basic aim of the code.
C
C         the first step taken by the code is a critical one
C         because it must reflect how fast the solution changes near
C         the initial point. The code automatically selects an
C         initial step size which is practically always suitable for
C         the problem. By using the fact that the code will not step
C         past TOUT in the first step, you could, if necessary,
C         restrict the length of the initial step size.
C
C         For some problems it may not be permissable to integrate
C         past a point TSTOP because a discontinuity occurs there
C         or the solution or its derivative is not defined beyond
C         TSTOP. When you have declared a TSTOP point (SEE INFO(4)
C         and RWORK(1)), you have told the code not to integrate
C         past TSTOP. In this case any TOUT beyond TSTOP is invalid
C         input.
C
C  INFO(*) - Use the INFO array to give the code more details about
C            how you want your problem solved. This array should be
C            dimensioned of length 15, though DDASSL uses
C            only the first eleven entries. You must respond to all of
C            the following items which are arranged as questions. The
C            simplest use of the code corresponds to answering all
C            questions as yes, i.e. setting all entries of INFO to 0.
C
C       INFO(1) - This parameter enables the code to initialize
C              itself. You must set it to indicate the start of every
C              new problem.
C
C          **** Is this the first call for this problem ...
C                Yes - Set INFO(1) = 0
C                 No - Not applicable here.
C                      See below for continuation calls.  ****
C
C       INFO(2) - How much accuracy you want of your solution
C              is specified by the error tolerances RTOL and ATOL.
C              The simplest use is to take them both to be scalars.
C              To obtain more flexibility, they can both be vectors.
C              The code must be told your choice.
C
C          **** Are both error tolerances RTOL, ATOL scalars ...
C                Yes - Set INFO(2) = 0
C                      and input scalars for both RTOL and ATOL
C                 No - Set INFO(2) = 1
C                      and input arrays for both RTOL and ATOL ****
C
C       INFO(3) - The code integrates from T in the direction
C              of TOUT by steps. If you wish, it will return the
C              computed solution and derivative at the next
C              intermediate step (the intermediate-output mode) or
C              TOUT, whichever comes first. This is a good way to
C              proceed if you want to see the behavior of the solution.
C              If you must have solutions at a great many specific
C              TOUT points, this code will compute them efficiently.
C
C          **** Do you want the solution only at
C                TOUT (and not at the next intermediate step) ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(3) = 0
C                  No - Set INFO(3) = 1 ****
C
C       INFO(4) - To handle solutions at a great many specific
C              values TOUT efficiently, this code may integrate past
C              TOUT and interpolate to obtain the result at TOUT.
C              Sometimes it is not possible to integrate beyond some
C              point TSTOP because the equation changes there or it is
C              not defined past TSTOP. Then you must tell the code
C              not to go past.
C
C           **** Can the integration be carried out without any
C                restrictions on the independent variable T ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(4)=0
C                  No - Set INFO(4)=1
C                       and define the stopping point TSTOP by
C                       setting RWORK(1)=TSTOP ****
C
C       INFO(5) - To solve differential/algebraic problems it is
C              necessary to use a matrix of partial derivatives of the
C              system of differential equations. If you do not
C              provide a subroutine to evaluate it analytically (see
C              description of the item JAC in the call list), it will
C              be approximated by numerical differencing in this code.
C              although it is less trouble for you to have the code
C              compute partial derivatives by numerical differencing,
C              the solution will be more reliable if you provide the
C              derivatives via JAC. Sometimes numerical differencing
C              is cheaper than evaluating derivatives in JAC and
C              sometimes it is not - this depends on your problem.
C
C           **** Do you want the code to evaluate the partial
C                derivatives automatically by numerical differences ...
C                   Yes - Set INFO(5)=0
C                    No - Set INFO(5)=1
C                  and provide subroutine JAC for evaluating the
C                  matrix of partial derivatives ****
C
C       INFO(6) - DDASSL will perform much better if the matrix of
C              partial derivatives, DG/DY + CJ*DG/DYPRIME,
C              (here CJ is a scalar determined by DDASSL)
C              is banded and the code is told this. In this
C              case, the storage needed will be greatly reduced,
C              numerical differencing will be performed much cheaper,
C              and a number of important algorithms will execute much
C              faster. The differential equation is said to have
C              half-bandwidths ML (lower) and MU (upper) if equation i
C              involves only unknowns Y(J) with
C                             I-ML <= J <= I+MU
C              for all I=1,2,...,NEQ. Thus, ML and MU are the widths
C              of the lower and upper parts of the band, respectively,
C              with the main diagonal being excluded. If you do not
C              indicate that the equation has a banded matrix of partial
C              derivatives, the code works with a full matrix of NEQ**2
C              elements (stored in the conventional way). Computations
C              with banded matrices cost less time and storage than with
C              full matrices if 2*ML+MU < NEQ. If you tell the
C              code that the matrix of partial derivatives has a banded
C              structure and you want to provide subroutine JAC to
C              compute the partial derivatives, then you must be careful
C              to store the elements of the matrix in the special form
C              indicated in the description of JAC.
C
C          **** Do you want to solve the problem using a full
C               (dense) matrix (and not a special banded
C               structure) ...
C                Yes - Set INFO(6)=0
C                 No - Set INFO(6)=1
C                       and provide the lower (ML) and upper (MU)
C                       bandwidths by setting
C                       IWORK(1)=ML
C                       IWORK(2)=MU ****
C
C
C        INFO(7) -- You can specify a maximum (absolute value of)
C              stepsize, so that the code
C              will avoid passing over very

C              about the scaling of your problem, you can

C                       G(T,Y,YPRIME) = 0.)
C
C   RTOL, ATOL -- You must assign relative (RTOL) and absolute (ATOL
C               error tolerances to tell the code how accurately you
C               want the solution to be computed. They must be defined
C               as variables because the code may change them. You
C               have two choices --
C                     Both RTOL and ATOL are scalars. (INFO(2)=0)
C                     Both RTOL and ATOL are vectors. (INFO(2)=1)
C               in either case all components must be non-negative.
C
C               The tolerances are used by the code in a local error
C               test at each step which requires roughly that
C                     ABS(LOCAL ERROR) <= RTOL*ABS(Y)+ATOL
C               for each vector component.
C               (More specifically, a root-mean-square norm is used to
C               measure the size of vectors, and the error test uses the
C               magnitude of the solution at the beginning of the step.)
C
C               the true (global) error is the difference between the
C               true solution of the initial value problem and the
C               computed approximation. Practically all present day
C               codes, including this one, control the local error at
C               each step and do not even attempt to control the global
C               error directly.
C               Usually, but not always, the true accuracy of the
C               computed Y is comparable to the error tolerances. This
C               code will usually, but not always, deliver a more
C               accurate solution if you reduce the tolerances and
C               integrate again. By comparing two such solutions you
C               can get a fairly reliable idea of the true error in the
C               solution at the bigger tolerances.
C
C               Setting ATOL=0. results in a pure relative error test on
C               that component. Setting RTOL=0. results in a pure
C               absolute error test on that component. A mixed test
C               with non-zero RTOL and ATOL corresponds roughly to a
C               relative error test when the solution component is much
C               bigger than ATOL and to an absolute error test when the
C               solution component is smaller than the threshhold ATOL.
C
C               The code will not attempt to compute a solution at an
C               accuracy unreasonable for the machine being used. It
C               will advise you if you ask for too much accuracy and
C               inform you as to the maximum accuracy it believes
C               possible.
C
C  RWORK(*) --  Dimension this real work array of length LRW in your
C               calling program.
C
C  LRW -- Set it to the declared length of the RWORK array.
C               You must have
C                    LRW >= 40+(MAXORD+4)*NEQ+NEQ**2
C               for the full (dense) JACOBIAN case (when INFO(6)=0), or
C                    LRW >= 40+(MAXORD+4)*NEQ+(2*ML+MU+1)*NEQ
C               for the banded user-defined JACOBIAN case
C               (when INFO(5)=1 and INFO(6)=1), or
C                     LRW >= 40+(MAXORD+4)*NEQ+(2*ML+MU+1)*NEQ
C                           +2*(NEQ/(ML+MU+1)+1)
C               for the banded finite-difference-generated JACOBIAN case
C               (when INFO(5)=0 and INFO(6)=1)
C
C  IWORK(*) --  Dimension this integer work array of length LIW in
C               your calling program.
C
C  LIW -- Set it to the declared length of the IWORK array.
C               you must have LIW >= 20+NEQ
C
C  RPAR, IPAR -- These are parameter arrays, of real and integer
C               type, respectively. You can use them for communication
C               between your program that calls DDASSL and the
C               RES subroutine (and the JAC subroutine). They are not
C               altered by DDASSL. If you do not need RPAR or IPAR,
C               ignore these parameters by treating them as dummy
C               arguments. If you do choose to use them, dimension
C               them in your calling program and in RES (and in JAC)
C               as arrays of appropriate length.
C
C  JAC -- If you have set INFO(5)=0, you can ignore this parameter
C               by treating it as a dummy argument. Otherwise, you must
C               provide a subroutine of the form
C               JAC(T,Y,YPRIME,PD,CJ,RPAR,IPAR)
C               to define the matrix of partial derivatives
C               PD=DG/DY+CJ*DG/DYPRIME
C               CJ is a scalar which is input to JAC.
C               For the given values of T,Y,YPRIME, the
C               subroutine must evaluate the non-zero partial
C               derivatives for each equation and each solution
C               component, and store these values in the
C               matrix PD. The elements of PD are set to zero
C               before each call to JAC so only non-zero elements
C               need to be defined.
C
C               Subroutine JAC must not alter T,Y,(*),YPRIME(*), or CJ.
C               You must declare the name JAC in an
C               EXTERNAL STATEMENT in your program that calls
C               DDASSL. You must dimension Y, YPRIME and PD
C               in JAC.
C
C               The way you must store the elements into the PD matrix
C               depends on the structure of the matrix which you
C               indicated by INFO(6).
C               *** INFO(6)=0 -- Full (dense) matrix ***
C                   Give PD a first dimension of NEQ.
C                   When you evaluate the (non-zero) partial derivative
C                   of equation I with respect to variable J, you must
C                   store it in PD according to
C                   PD(I,J) = * DG(I)/DY(J)+CJ*DG(I)/DYPRIME(J)*
C               *** INFO(6)=1 -- Banded JACOBIAN with ML lower and MU
C                   upper diagonal bands (refer to INFO(6) description
C                   of ML and MU) ***
C                   Give PD a first dimension of 2*ML+MU+1.
C                   when you evaluate the (non-zero) partial derivative
C                   of equation I with respect to variable J, you must
C                   store it in PD according to
C                   IROW = I - J + ML + MU + 1
C                   PD(IROW,J) = *DG(I)/DY(J)+CJ*DG(I)/DYPRIME(J)*
C               RPAR and IPAR are real and integer parameter arrays
C               which you can use for communication between your calling
C               program and your JACOBIAN subroutine JAC. They are not
C               altered by DDASSL. If you do not need RPAR or IPAR,
C               ignore these parameters by treating them as dummy
C               arguments. If you do choose to use them, dimension
C               them in your calling program and in JAC as arrays of
C               appropriate length.
C
C
C
C  OPTIONALLY REPLACEABLE NORM ROUTINE:
C  DDASSL uses a weighted norm DDANRM to measure the size
C  of vectors such as the estimated error in each step.
C  A FUNCTION subprogram
C    real*8 FUNCTION DDANRM(NEQ,V,WT,RPAR,IPAR)
C    DIMENSION V(NEQ),WT(NEQ)
C  is used to define this norm. Here, V is the vector
C  whose norm is to be computed, and WT is a vector of
C  weights.  A DDANRM routine has been included with DDASSL
C  which computes the weighted root-mean-square norm
C  given by
C    DDANRM=SQRT((1/NEQ)*SUM(V(I)/WT(I))**2)
C  this norm is suitable for most problems. In some
C  special cases, it may be more convenient and/or
C  efficient to define your own norm by writing a function
C  subprogram to be called instead of DDANRM. This should
C  ,however, be attempted only after careful thought and
C  consideration.
C
C
C------OUTPUT-AFTER ANY RETURN FROM DDASSL----
C
C  The principal aim of the code is to return a computed solution at
C  TOUT, although it is also possible to obtain intermediate results
C  along the way. To find out whether the code achieved its goal
C  or if the integration process was interrupted before the task was
C  completed, you must check the IDID parameter.
C
C
C   T -- The solution was successfully advanced to the
C               output value of T.
C
C     Y(*) -- Contains the computed solution approximation at T.
C
C     YPRIME(*) -- Contains the computed derivative
C               approximation at T.
C
C     IDID -- Reports what the code did.
C
C                     *** Task completed ***
C                Reported by positive values of IDID
C
C     IDID = 1 -- A step was successfully taken in the
C       intermediate-output mode. The code has not yet reached TOUT.
C
C     IDID = 2 -- The integration to TOUT was successfully
C       completed (T=TOUT) by stepping exactly to TOUT.
C
C     IDID = 3 -- The integration to TOUT was successfully completed (T=TOUT) by 
!       stepping past TOUT. Y(*) is obtained by interpolation. YPRIME(*) is obtained by interpolation.
C
C                    *** Task interrupted ***
C                Reported by negative values of IDID
C
!     IDID = -1, The code has taken about 500 steps. If you want to continue, set INFO(1) = 1 and
!       call the code again. An additional 500 steps will be allowed.
!
!     IDID = -2, The error tolerances are too stringent. The error tolerances RTOL, ATOL have been
!       increased to values the code estimates appropriate for continuing. You may want to 
!	change them yourself. If you are sure you want to continue with relaxed error 
!	tolerances, set INFO(1)=1 and call the code again.
!
!     IDID = -3  The local error test cannot be satisfied because you specified a zero component in ATOL
!       and the corresponding computed solution component is zero. Thus, a pure relative error
!       test is impossible for this component. A solution component is zero and you set the
!       corresponding component of ATOL to zero. If you are sure you want to continue, you must 
!	first alter the error criterion to use positive values for those components of ATOL 
!	corresponding to zero solution components, then set INFO(1)=1 and call the code again.
!
!     IDID = -6, Repeated error test failures occurred on the last attempted step in DDASSL. A singularity 
!     	in the solution may be present. If you are absolutely certain you want to continue, you 
!	should restart the integration. (Provide initial values of Y and YPRIME which are consistent)
!
!     IDID = -7, Repeated convergence test failures occurred on the last attempted step in DDASSL. An 
!     	inaccurate or ill-conditioned JACOBIAN may be the problem. If you are absolutely certain 
!	you want to continue, you should restart the integration.
!
!     IDID = -8, The matrix of partial derivatives is singular. Some of your equations may be redundant.
!       could be removed, and then DDASSL could solve the problem. It is also possible
!       that a solution to your problem either does not exist or is not unique.
!
!     IDID = -9, DDASSL had multiple convergence test (corrector) failures, preceeded by multiple error
!       test failures, on the last attempted step. It is possible that your problem is ill-posed, 
!	and cannot be solved using this code. Or, there may be a discontinuity or a singularity in 
!	the solution. If you are absolutely certain you want to continue, you should restart the integration.
!
!     IDID =-10, DDASSL had multiple convergence test failures because IRES was equal to minus one.
!       If you are absolutely certain you want to continue, you should restart the integration.
!
!     IDID =-11, IRES=-2 was encountered, and control is being returned to the calling program.
!
!     IDID =-12, DDASSL failed to compute the initial YPRIME. This could happen because the initial 
!       approximation to YPRIME was not very good, or if a YPRIME consistent with the initial Y does not 
!       exist. The problem could also be caused by an inaccurate or singular iteration matrix.
C
C
C     IDID = -13,..,-32 -- Not applicable for this code
C
C                    *** Task terminated ***
C                Reported by the value of IDID=-33
C
C     IDID = -33 -- The code has encountered trouble from which
C       it cannot recover. A message is printed explaining the trouble and control is returned
C       to the calling program. For example, this occurs when invalid input is detected.
C
C     RTOL, ATOL -- These quantities remain unchanged except when IDID = -2. In this case, 
!       the error tolerances have been increased by the code to values which are estimated to
C       be appropriate for continuing the integration. However, the reported solution at T was obtained using 
!       the input values of RTOL and ATOL.
C
C   RWORK, IWORK -- Contain information which is usually of no
C               interest to the user but necessary for subsequent calls.
C               However, you may find use for
C
C               RWORK(3)--Which contains the step size H to be
C                       attempted on the next step.
C
C               RWORK(4)--Which contains the current value of the
C                       independent variable, i.e., the farthest point
C                       integration has reached. This will be different
C                       from T only when interpolation has been
C                       performed (IDID=3).
C
C               RWORK(7)--Which contains the stepsize used
C                       on the last successful step.
C
C               IWORK(7)--Which contains the order of the method to
C                       be attempted on the next step.
C
C               IWORK(8)--Which contains the order of the method used
C                       on the last step.
C
C               IWORK(11)--Which contains the number of steps taken so
C                        far.
C
C               IWORK(12)--Which contains the number of calls to RES
C                        so far.
C

C                        the matrix of partial derivatives needed so
C                        far.
C
C               IWORK(14)--Which contains the total number

C
C               IWORK(15)--Which contains the total number
C                        of convergence test failures so far.
C                        (includes singular iteration matrix
C                        failures.)
C
C
C
C   INPUT -- What to do to continue the integration
C            (calls after the first)                **
C
C     This code is organized so that subsequent calls to continue the
C     integration involve little (if any) additional effort on your
C     part. You must monitor the IDID parameter in order to determine
C     what to do next.
C
C     Recalling that the principal task of the code is to integrate
C     from T to TOUT (the interval mode), usually all you will need
C     to do is specify a new TOUT upon reaching the current TOUT.
C
C     Do not alter any quantity not specifically permitted below,
C     in particular do not alter NEQ,T,Y(*),YPRIME(*),RWORK(*),IWORK(*)
C     or the differential equation in subroutine RES. Any such
C     alteration constitutes a new problem and must be treated as such,
C     i.e., you must start afresh.
C
C     You cannot change from vector to scalar error control or vice
C     versa (INFO(2)), but you can change the size of the entries of
C     RTOL, ATOL. Increasing a tolerance makes the equation easier
C     to integrate. Decreasing a tolerance will make the equation
C     harder to integrate and should generally be avoided.
C
C     You can switch from the intermediate-output mode to the
C     interval mode (INFO(3)) or vice versa at any time.
C
C     If it has been necessary to prevent the integration from going
C     past a point TSTOP (INFO(4), RWORK(1)), keep in mind that the
C     code will not integrate to any TOUT beyond the currently
C     specified TSTOP. Once TSTOP has been reached you must change
C     the value of TSTOP or set INFO(4)=0. You may change INFO(4)
C     or TSTOP at any time but you must supply the value of TSTOP in
C     RWORK(1) whenever you set INFO(4)=1.
C
C     Do not change INFO(5), INFO(6), IWORK(1), or IWORK(2)
C     unless you are going to restart the code.

C***PURPOSE  SNSQE is the easy-to-use version of SNSQ which finds a zero
C            of a system of N nonlinear functions in N variables by a
C            modification of Powell hybrid method.  This code is the
C            combination of the MINPACK codes(Argonne) HYBRD1 and HYBRJ1
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C 1. Purpose.
C
C
C       The purpose of SNSQE is to find a zero of a system of N non-
C       linear functions in N variables by a modification of the Powell
C       hybrid method.  This is done by using the more general nonlinear
C       equation solver SNSQ.  The user must provide a subroutine which
C       calculates the functions.  The user has the option of either to
C       provide a subroutine which calculates the Jacobian or to let the
C       code calculate it by a forward-difference approximation.  This
C       code is the combination of the MINPACK codes (Argonne) HYBRD1
C       and HYBRJ1.

C 2. Subroutine and Type Statements.
C
C       SUBROUTINE SNSQE(FCN,JAC,IOPT,N,X,FVEC,TOL,NPRINT,INFO,
C      *                  WA,LWA)
C       INTEGER IOPT,N,NPRINT,INFO,LWA
C       REAL TOL
C       REAL X(N),FVEC(N),WA(LWA)
C       EXTERNAL FCN,JAC
C
C
C 3. Parameters.
C
C       Parameters designated as input parameters must be specified on
C       entry to SNSQE and are not changed on exit, while parameters
C       designated as output parameters need not be specified on entry
C       and are set to appropriate values on exit from SNSQE.
C
C       FCN is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which calculates
C         the functions.  FCN must be declared in an EXTERNAL statement
C         in the user calling program, and should be written as follows.
C
C         SUBROUTINE FCN(N,X,FVEC,IFLAG)
C         INTEGER N,IFLAG
C         REAL X(N),FVEC(N)
C         ----------
C         Calculate the functions at X and
C         return this vector in FVEC.
C         ----------
C         RETURN
C         END
C
C         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by FCN unless the
C         user wants to terminate execution of SNSQE.  In this case, set
C         IFLAG to a negative integer.
C
C       JAC is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which calculates
C         the Jacobian.  If IOPT=1, then JAC must be declared in an
C         EXTERNAL statement in the user calling program, and should be
C         written as follows.
C
C         SUBROUTINE JAC(N,X,FVEC,FJAC,LDFJAC,IFLAG)
C         INTEGER N,LDFJAC,IFLAG
C         REAL X(N),FVEC(N),FJAC(LDFJAC,N)
C         ----------
C         Calculate the Jacobian at X and return this
C         matrix in FJAC.  FVEC contains the function
C         values at X and should not be altered.
C         ----------
C         RETURN
C         END
C
C         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by JAC unless the
C         user wants to terminate execution of SNSQE.  In this case, set
C         IFLAG to a negative integer.
C
C         If IOPT=2, JAC can be ignored (treat it as a dummy argument).
C
C       IOPT is an input variable which specifies how the Jacobian will
C         be calculated.  If IOPT=1, then the user must supply the
C         Jacobian through the subroutine JAC.  If IOPT=2, then the
C         code will approximate the Jacobian by forward-differencing.
C
C       N is a positive integer input variable set to the number of
C         functions and variables.
C
C       X is an array of length N.  On input, X must contain an initial
C         estimate of the solution vector.  On output, X contains the
C         final estimate of the solution vector.
C
C       FVEC is an output array of length N which contains the functions
C         evaluated at the output X.
C
C       TOL is a non-negative input variable.  Termination occurs when
C         the algorithm estimates that the relative error between X and
C         the solution is at most TOL.  Section 4 contains more details
C         about TOL.
C
C       NPRINT is an integer input variable that enables controlled
C         printing of iterates if it is positive.  In this case, FCN is
C         called with IFLAG = 0 at the beginning of the first iteration
C         and every NPRINT iteration thereafter and immediately prior
C         to return, with X and FVEC available for printing. Appropriate
C         print statements must be added to FCN (see example). If NPRINT
C         is not positive, no special calls of FCN with IFLAG = 0 are
C         made.
C
C       INFO is an integer output variable.  If the user has terminated
C         execution, INFO is set to the (negative) value of IFLAG.  See
C         description of FCN and JAC. Otherwise, INFO is set as follows.
C
C         INFO = 0  improper input parameters.
C
C         INFO = 1  algorithm estimates that the relative error between
C                   X and the solution is at most TOL.
C
C         INFO = 2  number of calls to FCN has reached or exceeded
C                   100*(N+1) for IOPT=1 or 200*(N+1) for IOPT=2.
C
C         INFO = 3  TOL is too small.  No further improvement in the
C                   approximate solution X is possible.
C
C         INFO = 4  iteration is not making good progress.
C
C         Sections 4 and 5 contain more details about INFO.
C
C       WA is a work array of length LWA.
C
C       LWA is a positive integer input variable not less than
C         (3*N**2+13*N))/2.
C
C
C 4. Successful Completion.
C
C       The accuracy of SNSQE is controlled by the convergence parame-
C       ter TOL.  This parameter is used in a test which makes a compar-
C       ison between the approximation X and a solution XSOL.  SNSQE
C       terminates when the test is satisfied.  If TOL is less than the
C       machine precision (as defined by the function R1MACH(4)), then
C       SNSQE attemps only to satisfy the test defined by the machine
C       precision.  Further progress is not usually possible.  Unless
C       high precision solutions are required, the recommended value
C       for TOL is the square root of the machine precision.
C
C       The test assumes that the functions are reasonably well behaved,
C       and, if the Jacobian is supplied by the user, that the functions
C       and the Jacobian  coded consistently.  If these conditions
C       are not satisfied, SNSQE may incorrectly indicate convergence.
C       The coding of the Jacobian can be checked by the subroutine
C       CHKDER.  If the Jacobian is coded correctly or IOPT=2, then
C       the validity of the answer can be checked, for example, by
C       rerunning SNSQE with a tighter tolerance.
C
C       Convergence Test.  If ENORM(Z) denotes the Euclidean norm of a
C         vector Z, then this test attempts to guarantee that
C
C               ENORM(X-XSOL) <=  TOL*ENORM(XSOL).
C
C         If this condition is satisfied with TOL = 10**(-K), then the
C         larger components of X have K significant decimal digits and
C         INFO is set to 1.  There is a danger that the smaller compo-
C         nents of X may have large relative errors, but the fast rate
C         of convergence of SNSQE usually avoids this possibility.
C
C
C 5. Unsuccessful Completion.
C
C       Unsuccessful termination of SNSQE can be due to improper input
C       parameters, arithmetic interrupts, an excessive number of func-
C       tion evaluations, errors in the functions, or lack of good prog-
C       ress.
C
C       Improper Input Parameters.  INFO is set to 0 if IOPT < 1, or
C         IOPT > 2, or N <= 0, or TOL < 0.E0, or
C         LWA < (3*N**2+13*N)/2.
C
C       Arithmetic Interrupts.  If these interrupts occur in the FCN
C         subroutine during an early stage of the computation, they may
C         be caused by an unacceptable choice of X by SNSQE.  In this
C         case, it may be possible to remedy the situation by not evalu-
C         ating the functions here, but instead setting the components
C         of FVEC to numbers that exceed those in the initial FVEC.
C
C       Excessive Number of Function Evaluations.  If the number of
C         calls to FCN reaches 100*(N+1) for IOPT=1 or 200*(N+1) for
C         IOPT=2, then this indicates that the routine is converging
C         very slowly as measured by the progress of FVEC, and INFO is
C         set to 2.  This situation should be unusual because, as
C         indicated below, lack of good progress is usually diagnosed
C         earlier by SNSQE, causing termination with INFO = 4.
C
C       Errors in the Functions.  When IOPT=2, the choice of step length
C         in the forward-difference approximation to the Jacobian
C         assumes that the relative errors in the functions are of the
C         order of the machine precision.  If this is not the case,
C         SNSQE may fail (usually with INFO = 4).  The user should
C         then either use SNSQ and set the step length or use IOPT=1
C         and supply the Jacobian.
C
C       Lack of Good Progress.  SNSQE searches for a zero of the system
C         by minimizing the sum of the squares of the functions.  In so
C         doing, it can become trapped in a region where the minimum
C         does not correspond to a zero of the system and, in this situ-
C         ation, the iteration eventually fails to make good progress.
C         In particular, this will happen if the system does not have a
C         zero.  If the system has a zero, rerunning SNSQE from a dif-
C         ferent starting point may be helpful.
C
C
C 6. Characteristics of the Algorithm.
C
C       SNSQE is a modification of the Powell hybrid method.  Two of
C       its main characteristics involve the choice of the correction as
C       a convex combination of the Newton and scaled gradient direc-
C       tions, and the updating of the Jacobian by the rank-1 method of
C       Broyden.  The choice of the correction guarantees (under reason-
C       able conditions) global convergence for starting points far from
C       the solution and a fast rate of convergence.  The Jacobian is
C       calculated at the starting point by either the user-supplied
C       subroutine or a forward-difference approximation, but it is not
C       recalculated until the rank-1 method fails to produce satis-
C       factory progress.
C
C       Timing.  The time required by SNSQE to solve a given problem
C         depends on N, the behavior of the functions, the accuracy
C         requested, and the starting point.  The number of arithmetic
C         operations needed by SNSQE is about 11.5*(N**2) to process
C         each evaluation of the functions (call to FCN) and 1.3*(N**3)
C         to process each evaluation of the Jacobian (call to JAC,
C         if IOPT = 1).  Unless FCN and JAC can be evaluated quickly,
C         the timing of SNSQE will be strongly influenced by the time
C         spent in FCN and JAC.

C     Subroutine DOGLEG
C
C     Given an M by N matrix A, an N by N nonsingular DIAGONAL
C     matrix D, an M-vector B, and a positive number DELTA, the
C     problem is to determine the convex combination X of the
C     Gauss-Newton and scaled gradient directions that minimizes
C     (A*X - B) in the least squares sense, subject to the
C     restriction that the Euclidean norm of D*X be at most DELTA.
C
C     This subroutine completes the solution of the problem
C     if it is provided with the necessary information from the
C     QR factorization of A. That is, if A = Q*R, where Q has
C     orthogonal columns and R is an upper triangular matrix,
C     then DOGLEG expects the full upper triangle of R and
C     the first N components of (Q TRANSPOSE)*B.

C       SUBROUTINE DOGLEG(N,R,LR,DIAG,QTB,DELTA,X,WA1,WA2)
C
C     where
C
C       N is a positive integer input variable set to the order of R.
C
C       R is an input array of length LR which must contain the upper
C         triangular matrix R stored by rows.
C
C       LR is a positive integer input variable not less than
C         (N*(N+1))/2.
C
C       DIAG is an input array of length N which must contain the
C         diagonal elements of the matrix D.
C
C       QTB is an input array of length N which must contain the first
C         N elements of the vector (Q TRANSPOSE)*B.
C
C       DELTA is a positive input variable which specifies an upper
C         bound on the Euclidean norm of D*X.
C
C       X is an output array of length N which contains the desired
C         convex combination of the Gauss-Newton direction and the
C         scaled gradient direction.
C
C       WA1 and WA2 are work arrays of length N.

C     Function ENORM
C
C     Given an N-vector X, this function calculates the
C     Euclidean norm of X.
C
C     The Euclidean norm is computed by accumulating the sum of
C     squares in three different sums. The sums of squares for the
C     small and large components are scaled so that no overflows
C     occur. Non-destructive underflows are permitted. Underflows
C     and overflows do not occur in the computation of the unscaled
C     sum of squares for the intermediate components.
C     The definitions of small, intermediate and large components
C     depend on two constants, RDWARF and RGIANT. The main
C     restrictions on these constants are that RDWARF**2 not
C     underflow and RGIANT**2 not overflow. The constants

C     Subroutine QRFAC
C
C     This subroutine uses Householder transformations with column
C     pivoting (optional) to compute a QR factorization of the
C     M by N matrix A. That is, QRFAC determines an orthogonal
C     matrix Q, a permutation matrix P, and an upper trapezoidal
C     matrix R with diagonal elements of nonincreasing magnitude,
C     such that A*P = Q*R. The Householder transformation for
C     column K, K = 1,2,...,MIN(M,N), is of the form
C
C                           T
C           I - (1/U(K))*U*U
C
C     where U has zeros in the first K-1 positions. The form of
C     this transformation and the method of pivoting first
C     appeared in the corresponding LINPACK subroutine.
C
C     The subroutine statement is
C
C       SUBROUTINE QRFAC(M,N,A,LDA,PIVOT,IPVT,LIPVT,SIGMA,ACNORM,WA)
C
C     where
C
C       M is a positive integer input variable set to the number
C         of rows of A.
C
C       N is a positive integer input variable set to the number
C         of columns of A.
C
C       A is an M by N array. On input A contains the matrix for
C         which the QR factorization is to be computed. On output
C         the strict upper trapezoidal part of A contains the strict
C         upper trapezoidal part of R, and the lower trapezoidal
C         part of A contains a factored form of Q (the non-trivial
C         elements of the U vectors described above).
C
C       LDA is a positive integer input variable not less than M
C         which specifies the leading dimension of the array A.
C
C       PIVOT is a logical input variable. If pivot is set .TRUE.,
C         then column pivoting is enforced. If pivot is set .FALSE.,
C         then no column pivoting is done.
C
C       IPVT is an integer output array of length LIPVT. IPVT
C         defines the permutation matrix P such that A*P = Q*R.
C         Column J of P is column IPVT(J) of the identity matrix.
C         If pivot is .FALSE., IPVT is not referenced.
C
C       LIPVT is a positive integer input variable. If PIVOT is
C             .FALSE., then LIPVT may be as small as 1. If PIVOT is
C             .TRUE., then LIPVT must be at least N.
C
C       SIGMA is an output array of length N which contains the
C         diagonal elements of R.
C
C       ACNORM is an output array of length N which contains the
C         norms of the corresponding columns of the input matrix A.
C         If this information is not needed, then ACNORM can coincide
C         with SIGMA.
C
C       WA is a work array of length N. If pivot is .FALSE., then WA
C         can coincide with SIGMA.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C 1. Purpose.
C
C       The purpose of SNSQ is to find a zero of a system of N non-
C       linear functions in N variables by a modification of the Powell
C       hybrid method.  The user must provide a subroutine which calcu-
C       lates the functions.  The user has the option of either to
C       provide a subroutine which calculates the Jacobian or to let the
C       code calculate it by a forward-difference approximation.
C       This code is the combination of the MINPACK codes (Argonne)
C       HYBRD and HYBRDJ.

C       EXTERNAL FCN,JAC
C
C
C 3. Parameters.
C
C       Parameters designated as input parameters must be specified on
C       entry to SNSQ and are not changed on exit, while parameters
C       designated as output parameters need not be specified on entry
C       and are set to appropriate values on exit from SNSQ.
C
C       FCN is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which calculates
C         the functions.  FCN must be declared in an EXTERNAL statement
C         in the user calling program, and should be written as follows.
C
C         SUBROUTINE FCN(N,X,FVEC,IFLAG)
C         INTEGER N,IFLAG
C         REAL X(N),FVEC(N)
C         ----------
C         Calculate the functions at X and
C         return this vector in FVEC.
C         ----------
C         RETURN
C         END
C
C         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by FCN unless the
C         user wants to terminate execution of SNSQ.  In this case, set
C         IFLAG to a negative integer.
C
C       JAC is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which calculates
C         the Jacobian.  If IOPT=1, then JAC must be declared in an
C         EXTERNAL statement in the user calling program, and should be
C         written as follows.
C
C         SUBROUTINE JAC(N,X,FVEC,FJAC,LDFJAC,IFLAG)
C         INTEGER N,LDFJAC,IFLAG
C         REAL X(N),FVEC(N),FJAC(LDFJAC,N)
C         ----------
C         Calculate the Jacobian at X and return this
C         matrix in FJAC.  FVEC contains the function
C         values at X and should not be altered.
C         ----------
C         RETURN
C         END
C
C         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by JAC unless the
C         user wants to terminate execution of SNSQ.  In this case, set
C         IFLAG to a negative integer.
C
C         If IOPT=2, JAC can be ignored (treat it as a dummy argument).
C
C       IOPT is an input variable which specifies how the Jacobian will
C         be calculated.  If IOPT=1, then the user must supply the
C         Jacobian through the subroutine JAC.  If IOPT=2, then the
C         code will approximate the Jacobian by forward-differencing.
C
C       N is a positive integer input variable set to the number of
C         functions and variables.
C
C       X is an array of length N.  On input, X must contain an initial
C         estimate of the solution vector.  On output, X contains the
C         final estimate of the solution vector.
C
C       FVEC is an output array of length N which contains the functions
C         evaluated at the output X.
C
C       FJAC is an output N by N array which contains the orthogonal
C         matrix Q produced by the QR factorization of the final approx-
C         imate Jacobian.
C
C       LDFJAC is a positive integer input variable not less than N
C         which specifies the leading dimension of the array FJAC.
C
C       XTOL is a non-negative input variable.  Termination occurs when
C         the relative error between two consecutive iterates is at most
C         XTOL.  Therefore, XTOL measures the relative error desired in
C         the approximate solution.  Section 4 contains more details
C         about XTOL.
C
C       MAXFEV is a positive integer input variable.  Termination occurs
C         when the number of calls to FCN is at least MAXFEV by the end
C         of an iteration.
C
C       ML is a non-negative integer input variable which specifies the
C         number of subdiagonals within the band of the Jacobian matrix.
C         If the Jacobian is not banded or IOPT=1, set ML to at
C         least N - 1.
C
C       MU is a non-negative integer input variable which specifies the
C         number of superdiagonals within the band of the Jacobian
C         matrix.  If the Jacobian is not banded or IOPT=1, set MU to at
C         least N - 1.
C
C       EPSFCN is an input variable used in determining a suitable step
C         for the forward-difference approximation.  This approximation
C         assumes that the relative errors in the functions are of the
C         order of EPSFCN.  If EPSFCN is less than the machine preci-
C         sion, it is assumed that the relative errors in the functions
C         are of the order of the machine precision.  If IOPT=1, then
C         EPSFCN can be ignored (treat it as a dummy argument).
C
C       DIAG is an array of length N.  If MODE = 1 (see below), DIAG is
C         internally set.  If MODE = 2, DIAG must contain positive
C         entries that serve as implicit (multiplicative) scale factors
C         for the variables.
C
C       MODE is an integer input variable.  If MODE = 1, the variables
C         will be scaled internally.  If MODE = 2, the scaling is speci-
C         fied by the input DIAG.  Other values of MODE are equivalent
C         to MODE = 1.
C
C       FACTOR is a positive input variable used in determining the ini-
C         tial step bound.  This bound is set to the product of FACTOR
C         and the Euclidean norm of DIAG*X if nonzero, or else to FACTOR
C         itself.  In most cases FACTOR should lie in the interval
C         (.1,100.).  100. is a generally recommended value.
C
C       NPRINT is an integer input variable that enables controlled
C         printing of iterates if it is positive.  In this case, FCN is
C         called with IFLAG = 0 at the beginning of the first iteration
C         and every NPRINT iteration thereafter and immediately prior
C         to return, with X and FVEC available for printing. Appropriate
C         print statements must be added to FCN(see example).  If NPRINT
C         is not positive, no special calls of FCN with IFLAG = 0 are
C         made.
C
C       INFO is an integer output variable.  If the user has terminated
C         execution, INFO is set to the (negative) value of IFLAG.  See
C         description of FCN and JAC. Otherwise, INFO is set as follows.
C
C         INFO = 0  improper input parameters.
C
C         INFO = 1  relative error between two consecutive iterates is
C                   at most XTOL.
C
C         INFO = 2  number of calls to FCN has reached or exceeded
C                   MAXFEV.
C
C         INFO = 3  XTOL is too small.  No further improvement in the
C                   approximate solution X is possible.
C
C         INFO = 4  iteration is not making good progress, as measured
C                   by the improvement from the last five Jacobian eval-
C                   uations.
C
C         INFO = 5  iteration is not making good progress, as measured
C                   by the improvement from the last ten iterations.
C
C         Sections 4 and 5 contain more details about INFO.
C
C       NFEV is an integer output variable set to the number of calls to
C         FCN.
C
C       NJEV is an integer output variable set to the number of calls to
C         JAC. (If IOPT=2, then NJEV is set to zero.)
C
C       R is an output array of length LR which contains the upper
C         triangular matrix produced by the QR factorization of the
C         final approximate Jacobian, stored rowwise.
C
C       LR is a positive integer input variable not less than
C         (N*(N+1))/2.
C
C       QTF is an output array of length N which contains the vector
C         (Q TRANSPOSE)*FVEC.
C
C       WA1, WA2, WA3, and WA4 are work arrays of length N.
C
C
C 4. Successful Completion.
C
C       The accuracy of SNSQ is controlled by the convergence parameter
C       XTOL.  This parameter is used in a test which makes a comparison
C       between the approximation X and a solution XSOL.  SNSQ termi-
C       nates when the test is satisfied.  If the convergence parameter
C       is less than the machine precision (as defined by the function
C       R1MACH(4)), then SNSQ only attempts to satisfy the test
C       defined by the machine precision.  Further progress is not
C       usually possible.
C
C       The test assumes that the functions are reasonably well behaved,
C       and, if the Jacobian is supplied by the user, that the functions
C       and the Jacobian are coded consistently.  If these conditions
C       are not satisfied, then SNSQ may incorrectly indicate conver-
C       gence.  The coding of the Jacobian can be checked by the
C       subroutine CHKDER. If the Jacobian is coded correctly or IOPT=2,
C       then the validity of the answer can be checked, for example, by
C       rerunning SNSQ with a tighter tolerance.
C
C       Convergence Test.  If ENORM(Z) denotes the Euclidean norm of a
C         vector Z and D is the diagonal matrix whose entries are
C         defined by the array DIAG, then this test attempts to guaran-
C         tee that
C
C               ENORM(D*(X-XSOL)) <= XTOL*ENORM(D*XSOL).
C
C         If this condition is satisfied with XTOL = 10**(-K), then the
C         larger components of D*X have K significant decimal digits and
C         INFO is set to 1.  There is a danger that the smaller compo-
C         nents of D*X may have large relative errors, but the fast rate
C         of convergence of SNSQ usually avoids this possibility.
C         Unless high precision solutions are required, the recommended
C         value for XTOL is the square root of the machine precision.
C
C
C 5. Unsuccessful Completion.
C
C       Unsuccessful termination of SNSQ can be due to improper input
C       parameters, arithmetic interrupts, an excessive number of func-
C       tion evaluations, or lack of good progress.
C
C       Improper Input Parameters.  INFO is set to 0 if IOPT < 1,
C         or IOPT > 2, or N <= 0, or LDFJAC < N, or
C         XTOL < 0.E0, or MAXFEV <= 0, or ML < 0, or MU < 0,
C         or FACTOR <= 0.E0, or LR < (N*(N+1))/2.
C
C       Arithmetic Interrupts.  If these interrupts occur in the FCN
C         subroutine during an early stage of the computation, they may
C         be caused by an unacceptable choice of X by SNSQ.  In this
C         case, it may be possible to remedy the situation by rerunning
C         SNSQ with a smaller value of FACTOR.
C
C       Excessive Number of Function Evaluations.  A reasonable value
C         for MAXFEV is 100*(N+1) for IOPT=1 and 200*(N+1) for IOPT=2.
C         If the number of calls to FCN reaches MAXFEV, then this
C         indicates that the routine is converging very slowly as
C         measured by the progress of FVEC, and INFO is set to 2.  This
C         situation should be unusual because, as indicated below, lack
C         of good progress is usually diagnosed earlier by SNSQ,
C         causing termination with INFO = 4 or INFO = 5.
C
C       Lack of Good Progress.  SNSQ searches for a zero of the system
C         by minimizing the sum of the squares of the functions.  In so
C         doing, it can become trapped in a region where the minimum
C         does not correspond to a zero of the system and, in this situ-
C         ation, the iteration eventually fails to make good progress.
C         In particular, this will happen if the system does not have a
C         zero.  If the system has a zero, rerunning SNSQ from a dif-
C         ferent starting point may be helpful.
C
C
C 6. Characteristics of the Algorithm.
C
C       SNSQ is a modification of the Powell hybrid method.  Two of its
C       main characteristics involve the choice of the correction as a
C       convex combination of the Newton and scaled gradient directions,
C       and the updating of the Jacobian by the rank-1 method of Broy-
C       den.  The choice of the correction guarantees (under reasonable
C       conditions) global convergence for starting points far from the
C       solution and a fast rate of convergence.  The Jacobian is
C       calculated at the starting point by either the user-supplied
C       subroutine or a forward-difference approximation, but it is not
C       recalculated until the rank-1 method fails to produce satis-
C       factory progress.
C
C       Timing.  The time required by SNSQ to solve a given problem
C         depends on N, the behavior of the functions, the accuracy
C         requested, and the starting point.  The number of arithmetic
C         operations needed by SNSQ is about 11.5*(N**2) to process
C         each evaluation of the functions (call to FCN) and 1.3*(N**3)
C         to process each evaluation of the Jacobian (call to JAC,
C         if IOPT = 1).  Unless FCN and JAC can be evaluated quickly,
C         the timing of SNSQ will be strongly influenced by the time
C         spent in FCN and JAC.
C
C       Storage.  SNSQ requires (3*N**2 + 17*N)/2 single precision
C         storage locations, in addition to the storage required by the
C         program.  There are no internally declared storage arrays.
C
C
C 7. Example.
C
C       The problem is to determine the values of X(1), X(2), ..., X(9),
C       which solve the system of tridiagonal equations
C
C       (3-2*X(1))*X(1)           -2*X(2)                   = -1
C               -X(I-1) + (3-2*X(I))*X(I)         -2*X(I+1) = -1, I=2-8
C                                   -X(8) + (3-2*X(9))*X(9) = -1
